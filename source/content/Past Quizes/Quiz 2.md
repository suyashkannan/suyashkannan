> [!question] Describe the key features of the double-helix model of DNA, including the components involved and the interactions that stabilize its structure.
>> [!success]- Answer
>> The double helix model of DNA consists of two antiparallel strands, meaning they run in opposite directions. Each strand is composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone, with the sugar being deoxyribose and the phosphate group linking the sugar molecules. The nitrogenous bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) are attached to the sugar molecules and project inward, forming base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds, and guanine pairs with cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds. These base pairs are stacked upon each other like a pile of coins, with the sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside, forming the helix's structure. The double helix is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the stacked base pairs and by metal cations that shield the negative charges of the phosphate groups.
