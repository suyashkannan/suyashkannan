**Subject:** Seeking Guidance on Pursuing a Career in Paleontology

Dear Prof. Mondal,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Suyash Kannan and I am currently a first year BSMS student at IISER Bhopal. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in paleontology. I have a deep interest in dinosaurs and paleontology. I have been following your research on invertebrate paleontology at IISER Kolkata. I admire your work and would be extremely grateful for any guidance you could offer.

I wanted to ask you for advice on how I can best position myself to pursue a career in paleontology while being a student at IISER. Specifically, I would like to know which steps I can take, such as potential courses, research projects, or internships, to gain more knowledge and experience in this field. Any suggestions on how to get involved with paleontological research and any skills or areas of focus that would be beneficial for my aspirations would be incredibly helpful.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I look forward to any insights you might have and hope to hear from you soon.

Warm regards,
