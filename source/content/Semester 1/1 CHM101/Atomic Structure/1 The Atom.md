The atom consists of the nucleus (which constitutes the majority of its mass) and a number of electrons moving around it. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons, both of which are of roughly the same mass (1u) and differ only in the amount of charge they carry. The electrons are roughly 1/1836th the mass of the proton, however they possess charge equal and opposite to the charge carried by the proton. They work together to neutralize the charge of the atom, by being present in equal numbers.

The Bohr model ([[3 Models of the Atom]]) considers the movement of electrons in a fashion similar to the orbital movement of planets around the sun (nucleus). The electrons enter into new orbits once their previous orbit has been filled to its limit.
