It is impossible to determine the position and the momentum of an electron _simultaneously_. 
1. The electron is too small to see, and may only be observed if perturbed. (eg - collision with photon/electron, or applying field).
2. The more certain we are about the pos, the more uncertain we are about the velocity, and vice versa.
3. $\Delta x$ = uncertainty in the position
4. $\Delta p$ = uncertainty in the momentum

The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle has a mathematical form as well: $\Delta x\cdot\Delta p = \frac{h}{4\pi}$
Second form: $\Delta x\cdot\Delta v = \frac{h}{4\pi \cdot m}$

Macroscopic systems do not follow uncertainty, because the error in measurement is very low, we can measure the position and velocity simultaneously.
