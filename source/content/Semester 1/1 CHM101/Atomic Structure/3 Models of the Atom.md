Thompson discovers the electron in 1896 by applying high electrical potential across a gas. Rutherford gives the concept of nucleus, that consists of positively charged particles. Neils Bohr combines these ideas to give the Bohr Model of the Atom.

### Limitations of previous models

1. According to the Rutherford Model (RM), the electron accelerating around the nucleus would be expected to slow down eventually. 
2. Why do electrons need to orbit around the nucleus? Why are the orbits circular?
3. Considering the coulombic attraction between the electron and the nucleus, the decelerating electron would eventually spiral into the nucleus.

### Bohr's Postulates

1. Electrons did not radiate energy if they stayed in one orbit, these orbits were special in nature and were called stationary orbits. This tackles the first limitation
2. The electron moved to a higher orbit if it absorbed energy and would move towards the nucleus if it radiated energy.
3. To tackle the third limitation, Bohr postulated that the coulombic force b/w the electrons and the nucleus would be balanced by the centrifugal force being experienced buy the electron by virtue of its circular movement.  $\frac{mv^{2}}{r} = \frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon _\text{0} r^{2}}$
4. Taking support from Planck's quantum theory, which states that energy is not continuous and occurs in packets called quanta (of magnitude h/2π). For n quanta, the magnitude would be nh/2π, which would have to be equal to the energy of an electron in its orbit, ie its angular momentum.  $mvr =\frac{nh}{2\pi}$ 
5. Combining the above equations, we can accurately predict the value of the radius of any orbit of a hydrogen like atom.  $r=\frac{\epsilon _\text{0}n^{2}h^{2}}{\pi me^{2}Z}$
 6. r = n^2 x 0.0529 nm
 7. From the first equation, we can obtain the value of 1/2mv^2, which is the kinetic energy, and after substituting the value of r, we can obtain: $E=-\frac{Ze^{4}m}{8\epsilon_{0}^{2}n_{2}h_{2}}$
 8. Using the above equation, we can calculate the value of the energy radiated/absorbed when an electron jumps from one orbit to another. Upon comparing the resultant equation with Rydberg's formula, we can obtain the theoretical value of: $R=\frac{Z^{2}e^{4}m}{8\epsilon_{0}^{2}h^{3}c}$
 9. This also explains the atomic spectral lines of Hydrogen atom, by changing the values of n1and n2, any line can be obtained.

### Refinement of Bohr's model

- Bohr assumed that the nucleus only rotating around its own axis, but this could only have been possible if the mass of the nucleus was infinite. Since the nucleus is only 1836 times the mass of the electron, it oscillates around the Centre of gravity as well. Thus, the reduced mass µ = mM/(m + M), where M is the mass of the nucleus, which explains why isotopes show spectral lines at slightly different wave lengths. 

- According to Bohr, when an electron jumped from one orbit to the other, it should give a single sharp line on the spectrum, corresponding to the energy difference of its initial and final orbits.
- However, when viewed under a high resolution spectrometer, it was revealed that these sharp lines reveal 'fine structure', meaning each line actually contains several lines close together. Sommerfeld explained this by assuming the presence of elliptical orbits that precessed around the nucleus. He defined a new quantum number k, which was responsible for determining the shape of the ellipse (major axis/minor = n/k). This 'k' later became known as azimuthal quantum number/subsidiary quantum number. 'k' can possess values of 1 through 'n', where n/n would result in circular orbit and n/k-1, n/k-2... up to n/1 with the ellipses getting narrower as 'k' decreases. The quantum number 'l' = k-1, and is known as azimuthal quantum number.

- Some lines would further split into 2 lines called doublets, and this was explained by the fact that electrons can spin in two directions, clockwise and anticlockwise. The value of the spin quantum number was thought to be m.h/2π, where m is another quantum number, with values of +/- 1/2. The exact expression was found out to be $\frac{\sqrt{ s(s+1) }.h}{2\pi}$ where s is the spin quantum number, or the resultant spin of the electron.
 
- Zeeman showed that more lines appeared when the atom was subjected to an external magnetic field. This was because the elliptical orbits could take up only a few orientations under the influence of the magnetic field, rather than precessing freely. A fourth quantum number m was defined, that could possess values from -L,...0...,L. Thus, a single line on the spectrum would appear as 2L+1 lines when an external magnetic field would be applied to it.
