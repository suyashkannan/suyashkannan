In photoelectric effect experiment, it was found that light behaved like a beam of particles, but in the double slit experiment it was found that light behaved like a wave. This showed that light could behave like a wave _and_ like a beam of particles (called photons). In 1924, de Broglie proposed the existence of a similar wave particle duality for electrons and other microscopic particles. This was later verified by the Davisson Germer experiment. 

de Broglie proposed that if light could behave as both wave and particle, then an electron might also possess dual nature.

### de Broglie Wavelength

He theorized: $\lambda _\text{de Broglie = h/p = h/mv}$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength of an electron, and p is the momentum of that electron.

If microscopic particles possessed dual nature, then why cant macroscopic objects possess such a dual nature? 

### Moving ball experiment

m = 100g   $\lambda =\frac{h}{100.10^{-3}.10}$ = $6.626 \times 10^{-34} m$ 
v = 10 m/s : The wavelength here is so small, it is negligible, hence it is not wrong to believe that macroscopic particles do not exhibit dual nature for the most part.


### Association of Bohr's model and de Broglie wavelength:

According to Bohr's model, an $e^{-}$ can only exist in a stationary orbit that satisfies the equation:
$mvr = \frac{nh}{2\pi}$
$2\pi r=\frac{nh}{mv}$
$2\pi r=n\lambda _\text{de Borglie}$
$n=\frac{2\pi r}{\lambda}$

- Here 'n' represents the shell no. and the number of waves formed.
- As a direct consequence of this theory, the [[5 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] emerged.
