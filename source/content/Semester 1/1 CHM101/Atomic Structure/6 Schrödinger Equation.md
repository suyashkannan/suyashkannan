Changed the concept of electron moving in fixed orbits to that of electrons most likely to be found in certain regions of space.

- Electrons behave like standing waves (borrowed from [[4 Wave Particle Duality]])
- The amplitude of the electron standing wave is known as the Wave Function $\psi$
- Wave Function must be:
	- continuous
	- single valued
	- finite
	- The probability of finding an electron over the entire space, $-\infty$ to $\infty$ must be 1

### Schrödinger Equation
$H\psi = E\psi$
(H: Hamiltonian Operator)
we want $\frac{d^{2}x}{dy^{2}}$, so 
The partial differentiation of $\psi$ is E (total energy of system)

Total energy of the system = Kinetic Energy + Potential Energy 

$\hat{H} = -\frac{h^{2}}{2m} \frac{\cdot\delta}{\delta x^{2}} + \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$
If we consider electron to move only in one direction, we get

$\frac{d^{2}\psi}{dx^{2}} = -\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}\cdot \psi$

for x, y, z:
$\frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂x^{2}} + \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂y^{2}} + \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂z^{2}} = -\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}\cdot \psi$

$\left( \frac{∂^{2}}{∂x^{2}} +\frac{∂^{2}}{∂y^{2}} +\frac{∂^{2}}{∂z^{2}} \right)\psi = -\frac{4\pi^{2}}{\lambda^{2}}\cdot \psi$

this proves, H$\psi$=E$\psi$
This however does NOT imply that H = E, as H represents the Hamiltonian Operator.

_$\frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂x^{2}} + \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂y^{2}} + \frac{∂^{2}\psi}{∂z^{2}} + \frac{8\pi^{2}m}{h^{2}}\cdot(E-V)\psi=0$

1. When we solve this equation, we get three variables: x, y and z
2. These three values give us the location (probable location ofc) of the electron in the atom.
3. $\psi$ gives the orbital value
4. Orbitals are basically zones in 3d space where the probability of finding electron is highest
5. The soln of Schrodinger eqn are labelled as Quantum Numbers.
