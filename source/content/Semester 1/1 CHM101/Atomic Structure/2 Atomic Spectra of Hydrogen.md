Atoms, when subjected to electric discharge, the electrons absorb energy and jump into higher orbits, the absorbed energy is then released in the form of radiation when the electron de-excites.  This gives rise to discrete line, rather than continuous lines.

Spectroscopy is the study of the radiation emitted or absorbed. 

Before analyzing the spectra of H2 molecule, we must separate the molecule into individual H atoms by passing electric discharge at low pressure.

Balmer in 1885, showed that wave number of any line in visible spectrum is:
$\bar{\nu} = R (\frac{1}{n_\text{1}^{2}}-\frac{1}{n_\text{2}^{2}}$)
R here is the Rydberg constant, with a value of 1.097373 x 10^1 m^-1
The theoretical value of R is 1.096776 x 10^7 m^-1

There are multiple such series of lines, each lying in a different region of the spectrum:
1. Lyman nf = 1, UV region
2. Balmer nf = 2, Vis region
3. Paschen nf = 3, IR region
4. Brackett nf = 4, IR region
5. Pfund nf = 5, IR region
6. Humphries nf = 6, IR region

The lines get closer and closer, as the wavelength decreases and slowly a continuum is reached. The initial lines are easily distinguishable.
