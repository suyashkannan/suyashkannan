### Elementary Composition of Biomolecules

- **Biomolecules**:
    - Chemicals or molecules that are present in living organisms.
    - They include organic and inorganic compounds essential for life processes.
- **Cellular Pool**:
    - The sum total of all types of biomolecules, compounds, and ions present in a cell.
    - It represents the entire chemical inventory required for cellular function and metabolism.

### Central Role of Carbon in Biomolecules

- **Carbon-Based Chemistry**:
    - Biomolecules are primarily **compounds of carbon**.
    - The **chemistry of living organisms** is fundamentally based on carbon compounds. It is a versatile and predominant element in the field of chemistry.

### Biomolecules: An Overview

**Organic and Inorganic Carbon Compounds**

- **Not all carbon-containing molecules are organic.**  
- **Elemental carbon** is not considered organic.
- **C-H Bonds:** Some schools of thought define organic molecules by the presence of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds.

### Characteristics of Carbon in Biomolecules

- **Covalent Bonds:**
    - Carbon forms single bonds with hydrogen and both single and double bonds with oxygen and nitrogen.
    - Carbon can bond with up to four other carbon atoms.
    - Carbon atoms can share two or three electron pairs, forming double or triple bonds.
- **Carbon Skeletons:**
    - Carbon atoms form linear, branched, or cyclic chains.
    - Functional groups are added to carbon skeletons, imparting specific chemical properties.
- **Bonding Versatility:**
    - The diverse bonding capacity of carbon was a key factor in its selection for cellular functions during evolution.
    - Carbon forms molecules with varied sizes, shapes, and functional groups, which are essential in biological molecules.

### Types of Biomolecules

1. **Inorganic Biomolecules:**
    - Minerals
    - Gases
    - Water
2. **Organic Biomolecules:**
    - Carbohydrates
    - Lipids
    - Amino acids
    - Proteins
    - Enzymes
    - Nucleotides
    - Nucleic acids
    - Vitamins

### Molecular Weight of Biomolecules

- **Micro-molecules:**
    - Small size, low molecular weight (18 to 800 daltons).
    - Found in the acid-soluble pool. eg - minerals, water, amino acids, sugars, gases.
- **Macromolecules:**
    - Large size, high molecular weight (above 10,000 daltons).
    - Found in the acid-insoluble pool. eg - carbs, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids.

### Four Classes of Biological Macromolecules

|**Macromolecule**|**Building Block**|**Major Functions**|
|---|---|---|
|**Protein**|Amino acids|Basic structure and function of the cell|
|**DNA**|Deoxyribonucleotide|Hereditary information|
|**RNA**|Ribonucleotide|Protein synthesis|
|**Polysaccharide**|Monosaccharide|Storage form of energy|
|**Lipids**|Fatty acids & glycerol|Storage form of energy for long-term demands|

### Importance of Carbon in Cellular Chemistry

- **Carbon-Based Compounds:**
    - Most cellular chemistry is based on carbon compounds (organic chemistry).
    - Cells contain 70% water, meaning life depends on reactions in aqueous media.
- **Complexity:**
    - Cellular chemistry is more complex than other known chemical systems.
    - Most carbon in cells is part of polymeric molecules.
- **Chemical and Physical Laws:**
    - All biochemical processes adhere to chemical and physical laws.

### Functional Groups and Biomolecular Interactions

- **Functional Groups:**
    - Various functional groups can replace hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton, altering the moleculeâ€™s properties.
    - Functional groups determine the behavior and interactions of biomolecules.
- **Stereochemistry:**
    - The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms (stereochemistry) in a molecule affects its function.
    - **Stereospecific Interactions:** Biomolecules often require specific stereochemistry for proper interaction.

### Isomers in Biomolecules

- **Isomers:** Compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures.
    1. **Structural Isomers:** Differ in the arrangement of atoms.
    2. **Cis-trans Isomers:**
        - **Cis:** Functional groups are on the same side of the molecule.
        - **Trans:** Functional groups are on opposite sides.
    3. **Enantiomers:** Mirror-image isomers.
        - Example: L- and D-forms of amino acids. Only L-forms are used by cells.
