## **Water and Its Properties**

#### **Molecular Structure and Polarity**

- **Covalent Bonds**: The oxygen atom in water forms covalent bonds with two hydrogen atoms.
- **Electronegativity**: Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, causing an unequal sharing of electrons in the O—H bonds, making them **polar**.
- **Partial Charges**:
    - Oxygen atom acquires a **partial negative charge** (δ⁻).
    - Hydrogen atoms acquire **partial positive charges** (δ⁺).
- **Dipole Interactions**: The polarity of water molecules leads to attraction between the positive and negative ends of different molecules, resulting in **hydrogen bonding**.

#### **Hydrogen Bonding in Water**

- **Hydrogen Bonds**: Formed when a hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to an electronegative atom (like oxygen) and weakly bonded to an unshared electron pair of another electronegative atom.
- **Covalent vs. Hydrogen Bonds**: Hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds but responsible for many unique properties of water.
- **Unique Properties Due to Hydrogen Bonding**:
    - **High Surface Tension**: Water molecules at the surface are attracted inward, creating a surface "film."
    - **Low Vapor Pressure**: Hydrogen bonding makes it harder for water molecules to escape as vapor.
    - **High Boiling Point**: Water has a higher boiling point compared to other molecules of similar size due to extensive hydrogen bonding.

#### **Hydrogen Bonds in Biological Systems**

- Hydrogen bonds are crucial in:
    - **Protein structure and function**
    - **DNA structure and replication**
    - **Polysaccharide structure**
    - **Enzyme-substrate binding**
    - **Hormone-receptor interactions**
    - **mRNA and tRNA matching during protein synthesis**
	- **Directionality of Hydrogen Bonds**: Hydrogen bonds are most stable when the bonded molecules are oriented to maximize electrostatic interaction, resulting in highly directional and specific 3D structures. They are arranged so that the hydrogen lies in between the two atoms that share it. Thus, the positive charge lies between two negative charges.
- *Hydrogen bonding applications:*
	- **DNA**: Hydrogen bonds stabilize the double helix structure of DNA by holding base pairs (adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine) together.
	    
	- **Proteins**: Hydrogen bonds help maintain the three-dimensional structure of proteins by forming between amino acid residues or between proteins and solvent molecules, stabilizing protein folding.
	    
	- **Proteins and Ligands**: Hydrogen bonds influence the binding specificity and strength between proteins and ligands, such as enzymes and substrates.
	    
	- **Ammonia (NH₃)**: Ammonia forms hydrogen bonds with itself, contributing to its high boiling point and polar solvent properties.
	    
	- **Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)**: Hydrogen bonds form between HF molecules due to the high electronegativity of fluorine, enhancing its intermolecular interactions.
	    
	- **Alcohols**: Molecules with hydroxyl groups, like ethanol, form hydrogen bonds, increasing their boiling points and solubility in water.
	    
	- **Carboxylic Acids**: Hydrogen bonding in carboxyl group-containing molecules like acetic acid affects their solubility and acidity.
	    
	- **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)**: Hydrogen bonds between hydrogen peroxide molecules impact its physical properties and stability.

#### **Cohesion and Adhesion**

- **Cohesion**: Water molecules are attracted to other water molecules due to hydrogen bonding, resulting in phenomena like surface tension.
- **Adhesion**: Water molecules are attracted to other materials, which, combined with cohesion, leads to **capillary action** (movement of water through narrow spaces).
- **Surface tension**: water is pulled together creating the smallest surface area possible
#### **Capillary Action**

- Water's adhesive property allows it to be attracted to other materials, and through cohesion, other water molecules follow, enabling capillary action. Water forms concave meniscus, while mercury forms convex meniscus. This is due their adhesive forces.

#### **Surface Tension**

- Water has higher surface tension than most liquids due to hydrogen bonding, allowing it to hold a drop of liquid in a spherical shape.
- **Surfactants** (e.g., soaps and detergents) reduce surface tension by interfering with hydrogen bonds.

#### **Thermal Properties of Water**

- **High Heat Capacity**: Water can absorb and release large amounts of heat without significant changes in temperature due to the hydrogen bonds between molecules.
    - This property helps regulate Earth’s temperature and supports life.
    - Water requires more energy to raise its temperature compared to other liquids.
- **Latent Heat**: Energy absorbed or released during phase changes (solid to liquid, liquid to gas) without changing temperature.

#### **Density of Water**

- **Water's Anomalous Density**: Water is less dense as a solid (ice) than as a liquid because hydrogen bonds form a crystalline structure in ice, leaving more space between molecules.
    - **Ice floats** on water, allowing aquatic life to survive in frozen water bodies.
    - At 4°C, water reaches its maximum density (1.000 g/cm³), and below this temperature, it behaves atypically.
	    - Its density starts decreasing after reaching 4°C, and the density is of ice becomes 10% less than the density of water, causing it to float.

#### **Low Vapor Pressure**

- Water's low vapor pressure is due to the hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together, making it harder for them to escape as vapor.

#### **Boiling Point**

- Water has a **high boiling point** (100°C) compared to other small molecules due to extensive hydrogen bonding.
    - Example: **Ammonia (NH₃)**, with a molar mass of 17.0 g/mol, boils at –33°C, while water (H₂O), with a molar mass of 18.0 g/mol, boils at 100°C.
    
- What properties of water that result from hydrogen bonding make it essential to life on Earth?
	The low vapor pressure of water keeps the liquid water in all of
	Earth’s lakes and oceans from evaporating rapidly.
	
	If water did not have such a high boiling point, it would be a vapor
	at the usual temperatures found on Earth.
	
	The fact that ice floats allows fish and other aquatic life to survive
	the winter months.

#### **Water as the Universal Solvent**

- **Polar Biomolecules**: Dissolve readily in water because they can form energetically favorable interactions with water molecules.
- **Nonpolar Biomolecules**: Poorly soluble in water as they cannot form strong interactions with water molecules, leading to clustering due to hydrophobic interactions.
- **Hydrogen Bonds and Other Interactions**: Hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, hydrophobic forces, and van der Waals interactions, though individually weak, collectively contribute to the 3D structures of biomolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids.

#### **Freeze-Drying**

- **Lyophilization**: The process of freeze-drying involves removing water from a material by sublimation under low pressure, converting it directly from a solid (ice) to vapor without passing through the liquid state.

### **Summary of Water’s Key Properties**

1. **Cohesion**: Attraction between water molecules.
2. **Adhesion**: Attraction between water molecules and other materials.
3. **Capillary Action**: Movement of water due to adhesion and cohesion.
4. **High Surface Tension**: Due to hydrogen bonding.
5. **High Heat Capacity**: Water can absorb a lot of heat without a large temperature change.
6. **Less Dense as a Solid**: Ice floats on water.
7. **Universal Solvent**: Water dissolves polar substances easily.

These properties make water essential for life on Earth, from regulating temperature to supporting biochemical reactions.
