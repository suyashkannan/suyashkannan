### Oxidation of Carbohydrates: Central Pathway and Structural Roles

- **Oxidation of carbohydrates** is the primary energy-yielding pathway in most **non-photosynthetic cells**. Carbohydrates are broken down to produce energy through various metabolic processes.
- **Insoluble carbohydrate polymers** play a structural and protective role in the **cell walls of bacteria**, **plants**, and **connective tissues of animals**.
- Certain carbohydrate polymers, such as **glycosaminoglycans**, also act as **lubricants for skeletal joints** and are involved in **cell recognition and adhesion**.

## Introduction to Carbohydrates

### Chemical Nature:

- Carbohydrates are **polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones**, or compounds that yield these substances upon **hydrolysis**.
- While many carbohydrates follow the empirical formula **(CH2O)n**, some also contain elements like **nitrogen (N)**, **phosphorus (P)**, or **sulfur (S)**.

---

## Classification of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are categorized into four main size classes:

1. **Monosaccharides**:
    
    - Simplest form of carbohydrates, containing 3-7 carbon atoms.
    - Example: **D-glucose** (dextrose), which is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature.
2. **Disaccharides**:
    
    - Formed by the linkage of two monosaccharides.
    - Example: **Sucrose**, which consists of the six-carbon sugars **D-glucose** and **D-fructose**.
3. **Oligosaccharides**:
    
    - Short chains of monosaccharide units (typically 3-10).
    - Often found attached to proteins or lipids, forming **glycoconjugates** that play roles in recognition and signaling.
4. **Polysaccharides**:
    
    - Long chains of monosaccharide units.
    - Examples include **cellulose** and **starch**, which are **homopolymers** of D-glucose.
        - **Cellulose**: Composed of β(1→4) linkages, making it a structural component in plant cell walls.
        - **Starch**: Composed of α(1→4) linkages, serving as an energy storage molecule in plants.

## Functions of Carbohydrate Polymers

- **Structural Roles**: Insoluble carbohydrate polymers provide strength and protection in biological systems:
    
    - **Plants**: Cellulose in plant cell walls gives rigidity and structural support.
    - **Animals**: Carbohydrates in **connective tissues** (e.g., glycosaminoglycans) contribute to tissue strength and flexibility.
    - **Bacteria**: Carbohydrates in bacterial cell walls (e.g., peptidoglycan) provide a protective barrier.
- **Lubrication and Adhesion**:
    
    - Certain carbohydrate polymers, such as **hyaluronic acid**, are involved in **lubricating joints**.
    - **Glycoconjugates** participate in **cell-cell recognition** and **adhesion** processes, critical for immune responses and tissue development.

### **Monosaccharides Overview**

- **Definition**: Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates and are classified as polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones.
- **Physical Properties**:
    - Colorless, crystalline solids.
    - Soluble in water, but insoluble in nonpolar solvents.
    - Sweet taste.
- **Chemical Structure**:
    - Monosaccharides have unbranched carbon chains where one carbon forms a carbonyl group (C=O).
    - Each carbon atom, except the carbonyl carbon, carries a hydroxyl group (-OH).
- **Classification**:
    - **Aldoses**: Monosaccharides where the carbonyl group is at the end of the chain (aldehyde group).
    - **Ketoses**: Monosaccharides where the carbonyl group is within the chain (ketone group).

---

### **Size Classification of Monosaccharides**

- **Trioses**: 3-carbon sugars.
- **Tetroses**: 4-carbon sugars.
- **Pentoses**: 5-carbon sugars.
- **Hexoses**: 6-carbon sugars (e.g., glucose).
- **Heptoses**: 7-carbon sugars.

---

### **Chirality in Monosaccharides**

- Monosaccharides often contain **chiral centers** (carbon atoms attached to four different groups), which makes them optically active.
- The general rule is that a molecule with "n" chiral centers has **2^n stereoisomers**.

---

### **D and L Stereoisomers**

- **D and L configurations**: Refers to the orientation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the chiral center farthest from the carbonyl group.
    - **D-forms**: Hydroxyl group on the right.
    - **L-forms**: Hydroxyl group on the left.
- **Enantiomers**: These are a pair of stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other but cannot be superimposed (e.g., D-glucose and L-glucose).

---

### **Epimers**

- **Definition**: Epimers are monosaccharides that differ in configuration around only one specific carbon atom.
    - **Example**: D-glucose and D-mannose differ at carbon 2 (C-2).
- Two different carbohydrates (L and D of same carb do not count.)
---

### **Cyclic Structure of Monosaccharides**

- **Intramolecular Hemiacetal Formation**:
    - Monosaccharides with five or more carbons exist mainly as cyclic structures.
    - The carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) forms a covalent bond with the oxygen of a hydroxyl group within the molecule, forming a **hemiacetal** (from aldoses) or **hemiketal** (from ketoses).
- **Hemiacetal/Hemiketal Formation**:
    - **Aldoses**: React to form hemiacetals, where an alcohol group reacts with an aldehyde.
    - **Ketoses**: React to form hemiketals, where an alcohol group reacts with a ketone.
- **Haworth Projections**: Used to depict cyclic sugars with a three-dimensional perspective.

---

### **Anomers**

- **Definition**: Isomers that differ only in the configuration around the carbonyl carbon (the hemiacetal or hemiketal carbon) in cyclic forms.
    - **α and β forms**: Result from the attack of the hydroxyl group on either side of the carbonyl carbon.

---

### **Mutarotation**

- **Mutarotation**: The interconversion between the α and β anomers in solution, often seen with glucose.

---

### **Hexose Derivatives**

- **Modified Hexoses**:
    1. **Amino Sugars**: An amine group (-NH₂) replaces a hydroxyl group (-OH).
        - Example: **N-acetylglucosamine** in bacterial cell walls.
    2. **Deoxy Sugars**: One oxygen atom is replaced by hydrogen.
        - Example: Deoxyribose in DNA.
    3. **Acidic Sugars**: Have carboxyl groups, which impart a negative charge at neutral pH.
        - Example: **N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid)** in glycoproteins.

---

### **Measurement of Blood Glucose Levels**

- **Reducing Sugars**: Monosaccharides like glucose can reduce mild oxidizing agents like cupric (Cu²⁺) ions, which oxidizes the carbonyl carbon to a carboxyl group.
    - **Fehling’s Reaction**: Historically used to detect glucose in urine, now replaced by modern enzymatic assays.
- **Modern Glucose Measurement**:
    - **Glucose Oxidase Test**: Involves the oxidation of glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone, with hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. This is detected and measured using a colorimetric method via a test strip.

---

### **Introduction to Browning Reactions**

Browning reactions can be divided into two major types:

1. **Enzymatic Browning**: Involves enzymes like polyphenol oxidase and catechol oxidase.
    - These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of natural phenols into compounds such as **melanin** and **benzoquinone**.
    - This type of browning requires exposure to **oxygen** and is commonly known as **oxidation of food**.
2. **Non-enzymatic Browning**: Involves chemical reactions between carbohydrates, amino acids, and other compounds without the involvement of enzymes.
    - Includes two major processes: **Caramelization** and the **Maillard Reaction**.

---

### **Caramelization**

- **Definition**: Caramelization is the process of heating sugars to high temperatures, leading to their **oxidation** and the development of a characteristic brown color and caramel-like flavor.
    
- **Key Chemical Compounds**:
    
    - **Caramelans** (C₄₄H₃₆O₁₈)
    - **Caramelens** (C₃₆H₅₀O₂₅)
    - **Caramelins** (C₁₂₅H₁₈₈O₈₀)
- **Process**: When sugars are heated, they break down into various compounds, resulting in a complex flavor profile and color change, often used in food preparation and cooking.
    

---

### **Maillard Reaction**

- **Definition**: A non-enzymatic browning reaction that occurs between **amines** (from amino acids) and **carbonyl compounds** (from sugars), leading to the formation of a wide variety of flavorful and colored compounds.
    
    - **First Step**: Reaction between the aldehyde group of a sugar (e.g., glucose) and an amino group of an amino acid to form an **N-substituted glycosylamine**.
    - **Amadori Rearrangement**: The glycosylamine undergoes further rearrangement to form **Amadori products**.
    - This reaction was first described by French scientist **Louis-Camille Maillard** in 1912.
- **Mechanism**:
    
    - **Initial Reaction**: The aldehyde of a reducing sugar reacts with a free amino group, resulting in the formation of a **Schiff base** (R₁R₂C=NR₃), which later rearranges to form Amadori products.
    - **Dehydration**: Schiff base formation is followed by a slow rearrangement and eventual dehydration.
    - **Oxidative Decomposition**: Amadori products undergo oxidative decomposition, leading to the production of reactive carbonyl compounds, which can participate in further complex reactions.
- **Importance**: The Maillard reaction is responsible for the browning of foods like bread crusts, seared meats, and roasted coffee, and it significantly contributes to the flavor and aroma of cooked foods.
    

---

### **Glycation**

- **Definition**: Glycation is a **non-enzymatic reaction** between reducing sugars (like glucose) and free amino groups on proteins, DNA, or lipids.
    - This process leads to the formation of **Amadori products** and, eventually, **advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)**.
- **Health Implications**:
    - High concentrations of glucose, especially in diabetics, can modify tissue proteins via glycation, leading to complications such as **nephropathy**, **neuropathy**, **retinopathy**, and **cardiovascular diseases**.
    - Glycation of proteins like hemoglobin is commonly measured in diabetes management to assess long-term blood glucose levels, resulting in a product known as **glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)**.

---

### **Hemoglobin Glycation in Diabetes Mellitus**

- **Mechanism**: Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, undergoes glycation when glucose reacts with its N-terminal valines or the ε-amino groups of lysine residues.
    - This reaction does not affect hemoglobin’s function but is highly diagnostic for long-term blood glucose levels.
- **Clinical Relevance**: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) tests are widely used to monitor and manage diabetes as they reflect the average blood glucose levels over time.

---

### **Glycosylation Reaction**

- **Definition**: Glycosylation refers to the chemical reaction in which a **glycosidic bond** forms between two monosaccharides or between a sugar and an aglycon (non-sugar compound).
    
    - This process is essential in the formation of complex carbohydrates like **glycoproteins** and **glycolipids**.
- **Applications**: Glycosylation plays a critical role in various biological processes, including protein folding, immune responses, and cell recognition.
    

---

### **Maillard Reaction Products: Good or Bad?**

- **Positive Effects**:
    
    - **Antioxidant properties**.
    - **Bactericidal** and **antiallergenic** effects.
    - Inhibition of **browning** in some food products.
- **Negative Effects**:
    
    - Can act as **prooxidants** or **carcinogens**, depending on the type of Maillard reaction product and how the food is processed.
    - Excessive Maillard products (e.g., AGEs) are linked to various diseases, including diabetes complications.
- **Dietary Implications**:
    
    - **White Bread vs. Brown Bread**: Foods like white bread undergo less Maillard browning compared to brown bread, impacting flavor, texture, and potential health outcomes.

---

### **Summary of Carbs III**

1. **Enzymatic Browning**: Occurs due to the action of enzymes like polyphenol oxidase, requiring oxygen.
2. **Non-enzymatic Browning**: Caramelization and the Maillard reaction are key pathways, leading to the development of color and flavor in foods.
3. **Glycation**: Non-enzymatic modification of proteins by sugars, important in diabetes management.
4. **Glycosylation**: Chemical formation of glycosidic bonds, essential in forming complex carbohydrates and glycoproteins.
5. **Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs)**: Both beneficial (antioxidant) and harmful (carcinogenic) effects depending on the context.

---

#### **2. Glycosylation vs Glycation**

- **Glycosylation**:
    - Enzyme-mediated process where a sugar molecule is covalently attached to proteins or lipids.
    - Alters protein function (e.g., life span, interaction with other proteins).
    - **Example**: N-linked and O-linked glycosylation.
- **Glycation**:
    - Non-enzymatic attachment of a sugar (usually glucose) to an amino group of a protein.
    - Does not require enzymes and is often associated with negative effects like the formation of AGEs.
- ![[Pasted image 20241010003456.png]]

#### **3. Chemical Glycosylation**

- **Definition**: Coupling of two monomeric sugar units, or sugar and other aglycons (non-sugar molecules), through the formation of a **glycosidic bond**.
    - **Glycosidic bond**: A covalent bond that links two sugar molecules or a sugar and a non-sugar molecule.

#### **4. Disaccharides**

- **Formation**:
    - Formed by a condensation reaction, where **water is eliminated** and a **glycosidic bond** is formed between two monosaccharides.
- **Reversal**:
    - The glycosidic bond can be broken by **hydrolysis**, typically under acidic conditions, where water attacks the bond.

#### **5. Reducing and Non-Reducing Sugars**

- **Reducing Sugars**:
    
    - Monosaccharides like glucose can act as **reducing agents**, meaning they can donate electrons to other compounds.
    - These sugars can be **oxidized** by mild oxidizing agents like **ferric (Fe³⁺)** or **cupric (Cu²⁺)** ions.
    - Example: In Fehling's test, reducing sugars react with Cu²⁺, leading to the reduction of Cu²⁺ to **Cu⁺**, forming a red precipitate of **cuprous oxide**.
- **Non-Reducing Sugars**:
    
    - Sugars like **sucrose** that do not have a free anomeric carbon and hence cannot act as reducing agents.

#### **6. Fehling’s Reaction** (Test for Reducing Sugars)

- **Basis**: The oxidation of the **anomeric carbon** of glucose (or other reducing sugars) forms a **carboxyl group**.
- **Mechanism**:
    - In the presence of Cu²⁺ ions under alkaline conditions, glucose is oxidized, producing **cuprous oxide (Cu₂O)** as a red precipitate.
    - The reaction is facilitated by the equilibrium between the ring (hemiacetal) form and the open-chain form of glucose.

#### **7. Disaccharides (Nomenclature)**

- **Naming Conventions**:
    1. Identify the configuration (α or β) at the **anomeric carbon** of the first monosaccharide.
    2. Name the non-reducing monosaccharide on the left.
        - Use **“pyrano”** for six-membered rings and **“furano”** for five-membered rings.
    3. Indicate the carbon atoms linked by the **glycosidic bond**.
        - Example: In **maltose**, C-1 of the first D-glucose is linked to C-4 of the second D-glucose, denoted as **(1→4)**.
    4. Name the second monosaccharide.
        - Maltose: **α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucopyranose**.
        - In simplified form: **Glc(α1→4)Glc**.

### 8. Reducing and Non Reducing sugar:
- The first anomeric carbon must be a hemiacetal group for the sugar to be reducing.
- This hemiacetal group can transform into an aldehyde group and reduce the silver in Tollens's test to give the mirror formation.
---

### **Fermentation of Sugars**:
1. Sucrose and maltose are fermented by yeast as it contains sucrase and maltase enzymes. 
2. Lactose is **not fermented** by yeast as it does not contain lactase.

### Carbohydrates and Polysaccharides

**1. Overview of Polysaccharides:**

- **Polysaccharides**, also known as **glycans**, are high molecular weight carbohydrates found in nature.
- They are **polymers** made from monosaccharide units.
- Polysaccharides vary in their structure, defined by:
    - The identity of recurring **monosaccharide** units.
    - The length of their chains.
    - The types of bonds linking the units.
    - The degree of **branching**.

**2. Types of Polysaccharides:**

- Consists of D-glucose units linked primarily by **α-1,4-glycosidic bonds**, with **α-1,6 linkages** at branch points.
- **Branch points** occur more frequently in glycogen (every 8–12 residues) than in amylopectin.
- Stored primarily in:
    - **Liver** (7% wet weight in hepatocytes).
    - **Skeletal muscle** (2% wet weight).
- In histological analysis, glycogen can be visualized using the **PAS staining technique**, where glycogen appears bright pink due to reactions with Schiff’s reagent.
- **Function**: Glycogen can be rapidly broken down at its **nonreducing ends** to produce glucose during periods of fasting (glycogenolysis), or synthesized when glucose is abundant.

**2. Starch:**

- A **storage polysaccharide** found in plant cells, made up of D-glucose residues.
- Comprised of two components:
    - **Amylose**: A linear polymer of D-glucose linked by **α-1,4 bonds**.
    - **Amylopectin**: A branched polymer with both **α-1,4** and **α-1,6** linkages at branch points occurring every 24–30 residues.
- **Salivary amylase**: An enzyme in saliva that breaks down starch into maltose, which is then further broken down into glucose by maltase.
- ![[Pasted image 20241010081559.png]]

**3. Cellulose:**

- A **structural homopolysaccharide** consisting of D-glucose units linked by **β-1,4 bonds**.
- Forms tough fibers due to hydrogen bonds between cellulose chains.
- Humans cannot digest cellulose as they lack the necessary enzymes to break down the **β-1,4 bonds**.
- Cellulose acts as **fiber** in the human diet, aiding digestion.
- Microorganisms in the guts of termites, ruminants (like cattle), and other herbivores produce **cellulase** enzymes, which allow them to digest cellulose.

---
### Periodic Acid Schiff Test (PAS TEST):
1. Carbohydrates are oxidized with the help of periodic acid which specifically targets the diol group of the carb --> aldehyde group.
2. Now that aldehyde groups have been formed, the PAS Staining process begins, Schiff's reagent is introduced to the solution, which contains fuchsin and sodium metabisulfite + aldehyde --> colored complex =  magenta or pink.
### Heteropolysaccharides

**1. Bacterial Cell Walls:**

- Made from heteropolysaccharides, such as **peptidoglycan**, which contains alternating units of **N-acetylglucosamine** and **N-acetylmuramic acid**.
- The linear polymers are cross-linked by short peptides to provide structural integrity, varying by bacterial species.

**2. Animal Extracellular Matrix:**

- Composed of several types of heteropolysaccharides that provide **structural support** by forming a matrix that holds cells together.
- Protects cells and maintains the **shape** and **support** of tissues and organs.

---

### Fasting and Glycogen Metabolism:

**1. Liver During Fasting:**

- During short-term fasting, the liver maintains blood glucose levels through **glycogenolysis** (breakdown of glycogen).
- During prolonged fasting, glycogen stores are depleted, and glucose is synthesized via **gluconeogenesis** using substrates like lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, and amino acids.

**2. Cellular Processes:**

- **Autophagy**: The process by which cells break down and recycle components, discovered by Nobel Prize-winning research by Yoshinori Ohsumi. This process is crucial for managing malnutrition, infections, and diseases such as cancer.

---

### Key Differences Between Polysaccharides:

- **Cellulose vs. Hemicellulose**: Both are structural components of the plant cell wall.
    - **Cellulose**: A straight-chain polymer of D-glucose with **β-1,4 bonds**.
    - **Hemicellulose**: A cross-linked polysaccharide, often with a more varied monosaccharide composition.

---

### Glycogen Metabolism:

- Glycogen is metabolized at the **nonreducing ends** during glucose production (breakdown), while new glucose units are added at these same ends during synthesis.

**Epinephrine** plays a role in the regulation of glycogen breakdown during the body's **fight-or-flight response**.
### Salivary Amylase:
Salivary amylase is a glucose-polymer cleavage enzyme that is produced by the salivary glands. It comprises a small portion
of the total amylase excreted, which is mostly made by the pancreas. Amylases digest starch into smaller molecules,
ultimately yielding maltose, which in turn is cleaved into two glucose molecules by maltase.

### Cellulose digestion:
- Cellulase enzymes are produced by many cellulolytic microorganisms. These microorganisms, such as Trichonympha a symbiotic organism that resides in the termite gut, allow the host to derive energy from the glucose units stored in cellulose.

- Similarly, cellulases produced by microorganisms living in the rumens of cattle, sheep, and goats allow these animals to obtain energy from cellulose present in soft grasses in the diet. 

- The *bacteria Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus
flavefaciens, and Ruminococcus albus* generally are regarded
as the predominant cellulolytic microbes in the rumen.
