#### 1. **Basic Overview**

- **Amino Acids (aa)**: Building blocks of proteins.
- **General Structure**: All 20 common amino acids are **alpha-amino acids**, with a **carboxyl group (-COOH)** and an **amino group (-NH2)** bonded to the same **α-carbon** atom. They differ in their **R groups (side chains)**, which give them distinct properties.
- *Modified Amino Acids*: Some amino acids are modified post-protein synthesis or exist in living organisms without being part of proteins.

#### 2. **Amino Acid Naming and Codes**

- Each amino acid has:
    - **Name**
    - **Three-letter code**
    - **One-letter code**
    - Example: **Tyrosine (Tyr, Y)** is aromatic and contains a hydroxyl group (-OH).

#### 3. **Chirality and Stereoisomers**

- The **α-carbon** is a **chiral center**, leading to two **stereoisomers** called **enantiomers** (non-superimposable mirror images).
- Nearly all biological compounds with a chiral center occur naturally *in only one stereoisomeric form*, either D or L.
- **L-amino acids** are the predominant form found in proteins.
- **D-amino acids** exist in certain small peptides, bacterial cell walls, and peptide antibiotics.
- **Enzymes** catalyze the synthesis of **L-isomers** due to their stereospecific active sites present in the cells.

#### 4. **Categories of Amino Acids**

Amino acids are categorized based on the properties of their side chains:

1. **Nonpolar, Hydrophobic (9)**:  
    **Glycine (Gly), Alanine (Ala), Valine (Val), Leucine (Leu), Isoleucine (Ile), Methionine (Met), Proline (Pro), Phenylalanine (Phe), Tryptophan (Trp)**
    
    - Lack polar groups; cluster in protein interiors due to hydrophobic interactions.
2. **Polar, Uncharged (6)**:  
    **Serine (Ser), Threonine (Thr), Asparagine (Asn), Glutamine (Gln), Tyrosine (Tyr), Cysteine (Cys)**
    
    - Have polar functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds with water.
    - **Cysteine** can form **disulfide bonds** with another cysteine, creating **cystine**, important for protein structure. The disulfide bond is highly hydrophobic: ![[Pasted image 20241004130958.png]]
    - Asparagine and Glutamine are the amide forms of two negatively charged amino acids glutamate and aspartate.
3. **Charged, Polar (5)**:
    
    - **Positively Charged (Basic)**: **Lysine (Lys), Arginine (Arg), Histidine (His)**
        - Hydrophilic with positively charged R groups at neutral pH.
        - Lysine contains primary ammonium ion, Arginine has a positive guanidinium group, and histidine has aromatic imidazole group (functions as proton donor/acceptor in many rxn)
    - **Negatively Charged (Acidic)**: **Aspartic Acid (Asp), Glutamic Acid (Glu)**
        - Contain carboxyl groups with a negative charge at neutral pH.

#### 5. **Special Amino Acids**

- **Aromatic Amino Acids**: **Phenylalanine (Phe), Tyrosine (Tyr), Tryptophan (Trp)**
    - Hydrophobic, with R groups that absorb **UV light** (maximum absorption at 280 nm).
    - Tyrosine has a polar **hydroxyl group** capable of hydrogen bonding.
    - Light absorption by these amino acids is exploited in detecting and quantifying proteins in the laboratory using the technique of *absorbance spectrometry*.
### **Properties of Amino Acids**:
- They are amphoteric in nature: because of their $\alpha$ amino and carboxylic acid groups (depends on the pH of the medium)
- Each AA has a different pI value (isoelectric point)
- AA are completely ionised in normal physiological pH range. This is the reason why they have high melting point (increased ionic interaction)
- AA are ampholytes.

#### 6. **pKa and Ionization**
- Ka is the ionization constant, and stronger amino acids have larger Ka value.

- **Amino Acid pKa**:
    - **pK1** ≈ 2.2 (carboxyl group), **pK2** ≈ 9.0 (amino group), and **pKR** for side chains.
    - Amino acids have **multiple pKa values** due to their multiple ionizable groups.
    - **Titration curves** reveal pKa, buffering range, and dissociable protons of amino acids.
    - Stronger the acid, lower the pKa
    - AA have two values if pKa: for COOH and NH2 grps


### **Titration curves of Amino Acids**:
- We can obtain values of pKa1 and 2 AND the value of pI .
- AA have more than 1 pKa as they are polyprotic.
- The curve provides info about the buffering range of the amino acid.
- Based on the number of plateaus on the curve, we can determine the number of dissociable protons in the molecule.
- $pI = \frac{pK_\text{a1} + pK_\text{a2}}{2}$
#### 7. **Peptide Bonds**

- **Peptides**: Linear polymers of amino acids linked by **peptide bonds**.
- **Peptide Lengths**:
    - **Dipeptide**: Two amino acids.
    - **Tripeptide**: Three amino acids.
    - **Oligopeptides**: Short chains (~8 to 20 amino acids).
    - **Polypeptides**: Long chains (>50 amino acids).
    - **Proteins**: Composed of one or more polypeptide chains.
- There are roughly 8-4000 aa in a protein molecules. 

#### 8. **Diversity of Protein Structures**

- Proteins can be made from various combinations of the 20 amino acids.
    - For example:
        - 2 amino acids → 20 × 20 = 400 different molecules.
        - 3 amino acids → 20 × 20 × 20 = 8,000 different molecules.
        - A 100 amino acid chain offers a vast number of potential sequences.

#### 9. **Optical Activity and Chirality**

- **Optical Activity**: Amino acids can rotate **plane-polarized light**.
- **Chirality**: Amino acids exist as **L-** or **D-forms** based on their orientation. Only **L-amino acids** are found in proteins.
- **Enantiomers**: Mirror-image molecules that are not superimposable.

### Stereoisomers and Amino Acids

- **Stereoisomers**: Molecules that have the same chemical formula but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms.
    
    - **L and D configurations**:
        - In biological systems, especially in proteins, amino acids predominantly exist in the **L-conformation**.
        - **D-amino acids** are rare in nature but can be found in some bacterial cell walls and peptide antibiotics.
- **Amino Acids with Two Asymmetric Carbons**:
    
    - An example of such an amino acid is **threonine** or **isoleucine**. These have two chiral centers, making them capable of existing in multiple stereoisomeric forms.

### Aromatic R Groups

- **Aromatic Amino Acids**: Include **phenylalanine**, **tyrosine**, and **tryptophan**. These amino acids contain aromatic side chains and exhibit the following properties:
    
    - **Nonpolar/Hydrophobic**: These side chains are relatively nonpolar and can participate in **hydrophobic interactions**.
    - **Tyrosine**: Its hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds, making it an important functional group in enzymes.
    - **Tryptophan** and **tyrosine** are more polar than phenylalanine due to the hydroxyl group (in tyrosine) and nitrogen (in tryptophan).
- **UV Light Absorption**:
    
    - **Tryptophan**, **tyrosine**, and to a lesser extent, **phenylalanine** absorb ultraviolet light, contributing to the absorbance of light at **280 nm** in proteins.
        - **Tryptophan** absorbs more UV light due to its aromatic structure. The electrons in its indole ring can resonate with UV light, leading to energy absorption at **280 nm**.
        - **Mechanism**: The aromatic electrons in tryptophan resonate with photons of UV light at the right energy level (280 nm). This interaction is similar to a radio tuning into a specific frequency.

### Essential Amino Acids

- **Essential Amino Acids**: These are amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet.
    - There are **nine essential amino acids**:

    - **Sources**:
        - **Complete proteins** (contain all essential amino acids) come from animal sources and soy.
        - **Incomplete proteins** come from plant sources and may lack one or more essential amino acids.
        - "*limiting amino acid*" is used to describe the essential amino acid present in the lowest quantity in a food protein relative to a reference food protein like egg whites. 9. The term "limiting amino acid" may also refer to an essential amino acid that does not meet the minimal requirements for humans.

### Uncommon Amino Acids

        - **Desmosine** (derived from lysine, found in elastin)
        - **Selenocysteine**: A rare amino acid containing selenium instead of sulfur, directly incorporated during protein synthesis. (derived from Serine.)
- **Other Non-Protein Amino Acids**:
    
    - **Ornithine** and **citrulline** are intermediates in the urea cycle and involved in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis.
    - They play a role in the immune response by synthesizing polyamines for tissue repair.


*NOTE: • Some 300 additional amino acids have been found in cells.*

### Peptides and Proteins

- **Peptide Bonds**:
    
    - Formed between two amino acids by a **condensation reaction**, where a water molecule is released.
    - A peptide bond links the **α-carboxyl group** of one amino acid to the **α-amino group** of another.
    - This reaction is energetically unfavorable and requires activation of the carboxyl group for peptide bond formation.
- **Types of Peptides**:
    
    - **Dipeptide**: Two amino acids linked by a single peptide bond.
    - **Tripeptide**, **tetrapeptide**, etc.: Multiple amino acids linked by peptide bonds.
    - **Oligopeptide**: A short chain of amino acids (up to 20).
    - **Polypeptide**: A longer chain of amino acids, usually refers to proteins with molecular weight below 10,000.
    - **Proteins**: Larger polypeptides with molecular weight above 10,000.
- **Polypeptide Chain Functions**:
    
    - **Hormonal peptides**: Include hormones like **oxytocin** (stimulates uterine contractions), **bradykinin** (anti-inflammatory), and **insulin** (regulates blood sugar).
    - *thyrotropin-releasing factor* (three residues), which is formed in the hypothalamus and stimulates the release of another hormone, *thyrotropin*, from the anterior pituitary gland.
	    - *pancreatic hormone insulin*, which contains two polypeptide chains
	    - *Glucagon*, another pancreatic hormone, has 29 residues; it opposes the action of insulin.
	    - *Corticotropin* is a 39-residue hormone of the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal cortex.
    - **Toxic peptides**: Small peptides like **amanitin** found in mushrooms.
- **Multisubunit Proteins**:
    
    - Proteins can be made up of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits). These subunits can be identical or different.
    - Example: **Hemoglobin** consists of four subunits—two alpha and two beta chains—held together by noncovalent interactions. Hemoglobin can be described as a tetramer (four subunits) or a dimer of protomers.

### Molecular Weight of Proteins

- **Cytochrome c**: 104 amino acid residues.
- **Chymotrypsinogen**: 245 residues.
- **Titin**: Nearly 27,000 residues, found in vertebrate muscle.

### Protomers:
- Protomers are the structural units of oligomeric proteins
- They consist of at least 2 polypeptide chains.

### Biosynthesis of Amino Acids

- **Overview**:
    
    - Amino acids are synthesized from **carbon skeletons** derived from central metabolic pathways. However, humans cannot synthesize all amino acids, which is why some must be obtained through the diet (**essential amino acids**), while others can be synthesized (**non-essential amino acids**).
- **Metabolic Intermediates for Amino Acid Biosynthesis**:
    
    - The carbon skeletons of the **20 amino acids** are derived from just **7 major metabolic intermediates** across **three metabolic pathways**:
        1. **Glycolysis**:
            - **3-phosphoglycerate**
            - **Phosphoenolpyruvate**
            - **Pyruvate**
        2. **Pentose Phosphate Pathway**:
            - **Ribose 5-phosphate**
            - **Erythrose 4-phosphate**
        3. **Citric Acid Cycle**:
            - **α-ketoglutarate**
            - **Oxaloacetate**
- **Key Metabolic Precursors for Amino Acid Biosynthesis**:
    
    - **Pyruvate**
    - **Acetyl-CoA**
    - **Acetoacetyl-CoA**

### **Amino Acid Oxidation: Energy Source Overview**

- **Carnivores**: **90% of energy** comes from amino acids after a meal due to their high-protein diet.
- **Herbivores**: Amino acids provide only a **small portion** of energy; they mainly rely on carbohydrates.
- **Microorganisms**: **Scavenge amino acids** from the environment for energy.

---

#### **Key Pathways**:

1. **Deamination**: Removes amino groups, leaving carbon skeletons for energy.
2. **Energy Production**: Carbon skeletons enter the **TCA cycle**, generating ATP.

### Deamination in Amino Acid Metabolism

- **Deamination**:
    
    - Deamination refers to the removal of an amino group from amino acids.
    - **Oxidative Deamination**: Occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys and results in the production of **α-keto acids** and other oxidized products.
    - **Non-Oxidative Deamination**: Liberates **ammonia** (NH₃) without oxidation.
- **Conditions for Cystine Oxidation**:
    
    - Occurs during **excess protein intake**, when **protein degradation** exceeds demand, or in cases of **starvation** where proteins are used for energy in the absence of carbohydrates.
    - **Protein-rich seeds** like beans and peas store proteins in this form.

### Amino Acid metabolism occurs when:
- excess protein in diet

- protein degradation exceeds demand for new protein

- starvation when carbohydrates are not available

- protein storing seeds such as beans, peas, etc.

### Amino Acid Catabolism and Nitrogen Removal

- **General Strategy for Amino Acid Catabolism**:
    
    1. **Transamination**: Nitrogen is removed from the amino acid via transamination and collected in **glutamic acid**.
    2. **Deamination of Glutamic Acid**: Releases **NH₄⁺** (ammonium) via the action of **glutamate dehydrogenase**.
    3. **Removal of Ammonium**:
        - Ammonium can either be **excreted** or converted into a **less toxic form** like **urea**.
- **Alanine Transaminase (ALT)**:
    
    - ALT is an enzyme in the liver that catalyzes the conversion of proteins into energy for liver cells.
    - Elevated levels of ALT in the blood may indicate **liver damage**.

### Glucogenic vs. Ketogenic Amino Acids

- **Glucogenic Amino Acids**:
    - These amino acids can be converted into **pyruvate** or other intermediates that lead to glucose production via **gluconeogenesis**.
- **Ketogenic Amino Acids**:
    - These amino acids can be converted into **acetyl-CoA** and **acetoacetyl-CoA**, leading to the production of **ketone bodies** rather than glucose.
- **Glucogenic and Ketogenic Amino Acids**:
    - Some amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic, depending on the metabolic pathways they enter.

### Ketogenic Diet

- **Premise of the Ketogenic Diet**:
    
    - The ketogenic diet is based on the principle of **carbohydrate restriction** to force the body to use **fat** as its primary energy source.
    - When carbohydrate intake is minimal, the body depletes its glycogen stores, insulin levels drop, and the liver begins to produce **ketone bodies** from fats.
- **Ketosis**:
    
    - When ketone bodies accumulate in the blood, it leads to a state called **ketosis**.
    - Mild ketosis is a natural state during periods of fasting or intense exercise.
    - In healthy individuals, **ketoacidosis** (dangerously high ketone levels) is avoided by the body's ability to regulate ketone production and insulin levels.
- **Side Effects of Carbohydrate Restriction**:
    
    - Symptoms such as **hunger, fatigue, irritability, constipation, headaches**, and mental “**brain fog**” may occur during the first days to weeks of extreme carbohydrate restriction.

### Hemoglobin Structure

- **Multisubunit Proteins**:
    
    - Proteins can consist of multiple **polypeptide subunits**. When two or more subunits are identical, the protein is referred to as **oligomeric**, and each identical unit is called a **protomer**.
- **Hemoglobin**:
    
    - Hemoglobin is a classic example of a multisubunit protein consisting of four subunits: **two alpha chains** and **two beta chains**, held together by **noncovalent interactions**.
    - Each pair of identical subunits forms a **dimer of protomers**, making hemoglobin a **tetramer** of four subunits.
