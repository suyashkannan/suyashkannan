### **Carbohydrates**

Carbohydrates are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are classified into three main types: [[5 Carbohydrates]]

1. **Monosaccharides**:
    
    - Basic units of carbohydrates that **cannot be hydrolyzed** into smaller units.
    - **Based on the number of carbon atoms:**
        - **Trioses (C₃H₆O₃):** Glyceraldehyde, Dihydroxyacetone
        - **Tetroses (C₄H₈O₄):** Erythrose, Threose
        - **Pentoses (C₅H₁₀O₅):** Ribulose, Xylose, Arabinose (Deoxyribose – C₅H₁₀O₄)
        - **Hexoses (C₆H₁₂O₆):** Glucose, Fructose, Galactose, Mannose
        - **Heptoses (C₇H₁₄O₇):** Sedoheptulose, Glucoheptose
    - **Based on functional groups:**
        - **Aldoses:** Contain an aldehyde group (-CHO), e.g., Glyceraldehyde, Glucose
        - **Ketoses:** Contain a ketone group (C=O), e.g., Dihydroxyacetone, Fructose
2. **Oligosaccharides**:
    
    - Composed of a few monosaccharides (2-10) that can be hydrolyzed into smaller units.
    - **Types based on the number of monosaccharides:**
        - **Disaccharides:** e.g., Sucrose, Lactose
        - **Trisaccharides**
        - **Tetrasaccharides**
3. **Polysaccharides**:
    
    - **Non-crystalline**, **non-soluble** in water, and **tasteless**.
    - On hydrolysis, they yield monosaccharides.
    - Examples: **Starch**, **Cellulose**

### **Nucleotides** 

Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. [[4 Nucleic Acids]]

- **DNA**: Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries hereditary information.
- **RNA**: Involved in protein synthesis (mRNA, rRNA, tRNA).

### **Proteins**

Proteins are polymers of amino acids. Each amino acid contains:

- **Amino group (-NH₂)**, which is basic.
- **Carboxyl group (-COOH)**, which is acidic.
- **R-group** (side chain), which differentiates amino acids.

#### **Amino Acids**:

- Amino acids are organic compounds containing **C, H, O, N**, and some may contain **S**.
- Their physical and chemical properties are determined by the amino, carboxyl, and R groups.
- Common examples:
    - **Glycine:** R-group is a hydrogen atom (H).
    - **Alanine:** R-group is a methyl group (CH₃).
    - **Serine:** R-group is a hydroxymethyl group (CH₂OH).
[[3 Amino Acids]]

#### **Protein Classification**:

1. **Simple Proteins**: Composed only of amino acid residues, e.g., Albumins, Globulins.
2. **Conjugated Proteins**: Contain amino acids and a **non-protein prosthetic group**, e.g., Glycoproteins, Lipoproteins.
3. **Derived Proteins**: Denatured or degraded products of simple and conjugated proteins, e.g., Peptones, Proteoses.

### **Lipids**

Lipids are hydrophobic molecules consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but they contain **less oxygen** compared to carbohydrates.

#### **Simple Lipids**:

- **Esters of fatty acids with alcohol**.
- Types:
    1. **Neutral (True) Fats**:
        - Composed of **glycerol** and **fatty acids** (1 to 3 molecules).
        - Serve as a storage form of energy.
    2. **Waxes**:
        - Esters of fatty acids with alcohols other than glycerol.

### **Enzymes**

Enzymes are biological catalysts made up of proteins. They speed up biochemical reactions by lowering activation energy without being consumed in the process.
