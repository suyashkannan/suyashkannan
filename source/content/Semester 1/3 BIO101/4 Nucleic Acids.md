#### 1. **Nucleotides**

- **Structure**:  
    Nucleotides are composed of three components:
    
    1. **Nitrogenous base** (either a purine or pyrimidine)
    2. **Pentose sugar** (either ribose or deoxyribose)
    3. **Phosphate group**
- **Types of Nitrogenous Bases**:
    
    - **Purines**: Adenine (A), Guanine (G)
    - **Pyrimidines**: Cytosine (C), Thymine (T) (in DNA), Uracil (U) (in RNA)
    - ![[Pasted image 20241009223418.png]]
- **Sugar Component**:
    
    - **Ribose**: Found in RNA, has a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the 2' carbon.
    - **Deoxyribose**: Found in DNA, lacks a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon, having a hydrogen atom instead (-H).
    - ![[Pasted image 20241007214547.png]]
- **Nucleotide vs Nucleoside**:
    
    - **Nucleoside**: Nitrogenous base + Pentose sugar
    - **Nucleotide**: Nucleoside + Phosphate group
- **Phosphate Groups**:
    
    - Mono-, Di-, and Triphosphates (e.g., AMP, ADP, ATP)
    - Phosphate groups are essential for nucleotide polymerization.
- Naming of Nucleotides and Nucleosides:
	- Ns consists of : NB --Glycosidic Bond-- Pentose
		- Change purine ending to *-osine* and pyrimidine ending to *-idine*
	- Nt consists of : Ns + Phosphate ester at C5' OH group of the pentose
		- Naming of Nt is basically Ns + 5' monophosphate.

#### 2. **Nucleic Acids**

- **Types**:
    
    1. **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**: Contains genetic information for the synthesis of proteins.
    2. **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**: Functions in various roles during gene expression.
- **Components of Nucleic Acids**:
    
    - Polymers of nucleotides.
    - **DNA** contains 2’-deoxy-D-ribose.
    - **RNA** contains D-ribose.
- Chemical Synthesis of Nucleotides and Nucleic Acid:

#### 3. **Functions of Nucleic Acids**

- **DNA**: Dictates the sequence of amino acids in proteins and transmits genetic information from parent to offspring. It stores biological information essential for life.
    
- **RNA**: Plays diverse roles in the synthesis of proteins and other cellular functions.
    
    - **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**: Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
    - **Transfer RNA (tRNA)**: Acts as an adapter molecule in translation.
    - **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA)**: Major component of ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs.

#### 4. **The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

- The flow of genetic information:
    1. **Replication**: Making identical copies of DNA.
    2. **Transcription**: Copying genetic messages from DNA to RNA.
	    1. **Translation**: Decoding RNA to synthesize proteins.
#### 6. **Conformations of Pentoses**

- In nucleotides, pentose sugars are found in the β-furanose (five-membered ring) form.
- Ribose in RNA exists solely as β-D-ribofuranose.
- Deoxyribose in DNA exists as β-2’-deoxy-D-ribofuranose.

#### 7. **Sanger Dideoxy Sequencing**

Sanger sequencing is a method used to determine the exact order of nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) in a DNA strand. It works by copying the DNA and then using special chemical tricks to stop the copying at random points, which helps in reading the DNA sequence.

#### How it works:

1. **DNA Copying:** The process begins with copying the target DNA using an enzyme called DNA polymerase.
2. **Dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs):** During the copying process, normal nucleotides (A, T, C, and G) are added, but special modified nucleotides called _dideoxynucleotides_ (ddNTPs) are also included. These ddNTPs act as "stoppers" because once they are added, the copying process stops.
3. **Different Lengths:** Since the ddNTPs are added randomly, the copying stops at various points, resulting in fragments of different lengths.
4. **Separation and Reading:** The fragments are separated by size using a process called gel electrophoresis. Each fragment ends with a specific ddNTP (A, T, C, or G), and by looking at the end of each fragment, scientists can figure out the order of the nucleotides in the original DNA sequence.

#### Key Points:

- **Normal nucleotides (dNTPs)** are used for regular DNA synthesis.
- **Dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs)** stop DNA synthesis when they are added.
- By analyzing the length of fragments and the final nucleotide in each, the sequence of the DNA can be determined.

### Procedure:
1. **Prepare DNA template** and anneal a primer.
2. Set up a reaction mix with **DNA polymerase**, normal nucleotides (dNTPs), and **dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs)**.
3. **DNA synthesis** continues until a ddNTP is randomly incorporated, terminating the chain.
4. **Separate the fragments** by size using gel or capillary electrophoresis.
5. **Detect the fluorescent tags** (by laser) and assemble the DNA sequence.

#### 3. **Discovery of DNA's Double Helix Structure**

- **Key Scientists:**
    
    - **James Watson and Francis Crick (1953):** Developed the double-helix model of DNA.
    - **Rosalind Franklin:** Her X-ray crystallography images were pivotal in determining DNA's structure.
    - **Maurice Wilkins:** Contributed to the understanding of DNA's molecular structure.

    - The strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs (A-T and G-C).
- **Chargaff's Rule:**
    
    - Total purines (A, G) equal total pyrimidines (T, C) in DNA, leading to the complementary nature of DNA strands.

---

#### 4. **Model of DNA (1953)**

- **Structure:**
    
    - Double helix with two strands running in opposite directions (antiparallel).
    - Bases are located on the inside, and the sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside.
    - The helical structure repeats every 10 base pairs per turn.
- **Stability of the DNA Double Helix:**
    
    - Stabilized by base-stacking interactions and metal cations that shield the negative charge of phosphate groups.
	     - Base stacking interactions: - **Base stacking** refers to the attractive forces between the flat surfaces (aromatic rings) of adjacent nucleotide bases (Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine) in the DNA helix.
		- These bases lie almost flat and parallel to each other, forming **van der Waals interactions** and **hydrophobic interactions** between them.
- The bases stack on top of one another like a pile of coins in the double helix
    - Hydrogen bonds between base pairs also contribute to the structure’s integrity.
	    - The free ends of the nitrogen bases are also available for hydrogen bonding. This provides DNA easy access to other molecules like proteins.

- **Conformations of DNA:**
    
    - **A-DNA:** Short and wide, right-handed helix.
    - **B-DNA:** Common form found in living cells.
    - **Z-DNA:** Left-handed helix, less common.

#### 5. **Structural Flexibility and Variability of DNA**

- DNA can undergo bending, stretching, and unpairing (denaturation) due to thermal fluctuations.
- **Denaturation and Renaturation:** Heating causes DNA strands to separate (denaturation), while cooling allows them to reassociate (renaturation).
- The solutions of native DNA exhibit high viscosity because of the relatively rigid double helical, long and rod like character of DNA molecule.

---

#### 6. **Hydrolysis and Mutations in DNA and RNA**

- **Hydrolysis of RNA:** Under alkaline conditions, RNA is rapidly hydrolyzed due to the presence of a 2'-hydroxyl group, unlike DNA which lacks this group and is stable.
	- Results in two 2' and 3' monophosphate derivatives
- **Depurination:** The loss of purine bases (A or G) from DNA by hydrolysis of N glycosidic bond can lead to mutations, aging, and carcinogenesis.
- **Deamination:** Spontaneous loss of amino groups from cytosine leads to uracil formation, which can be detected and repaired in DNA.
- In viral DNA some bases might become *hydroxymethylated or glucosylated*. 
- Cells also contain nucleotides with phosphate groups in positions other than on the 5′ carbon
- These altered DNA can sometimes protect the genetic information. 
- Nucleic acid bases can exist in **multiple tautomeric** forms due to the presence of solvent-exchangeable protons.
- **Transition:** A <--> G or C <--> T
- **Transversions:** A or G <--> C or T

- **Primary Structure:** Sequence of nucleotides.
    
- **Secondary Structure:** Stable arrangements, such as the double helix in DNA.
    
- **Tertiary Structure:** More complex folding patterns found in chromatin or large RNA molecules like tRNA or rRNA.
    
- **G-Quadruplexes:** Higher-order DNA/RNA structures formed by guanine-rich sequences, stabilized by stacking of guanine tetrads.
    
- **Hoogsteen Base Pairs:** Alternative hydrogen bonding in nucleic acids, where A-T pairs in the major groove form different bonding arrangements.
