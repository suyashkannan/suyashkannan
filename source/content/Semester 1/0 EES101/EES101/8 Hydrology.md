### This Class: Aquifers, Types of Groundwater, Groundwater Movement, Effluent vs. Influent Streams

---

#### 1. **Aquifers**

- **Definition**: Aquifers are saturated geological formations capable of storing and transmitting significant quantities of water, yielding water to wells and springs.
- **Key Properties**:
    - **Porosity**: The capacity of the rock to hold water.
    - **Permeability**: The rock’s ability to transmit water.
- **Types of Rocks**: Sandstone, limestone, fractured volcanic and crystalline rocks can often serve as aquifers.

---

#### 2. **Types of Aquifers**

- **Unconfined Aquifer**:
    
    - **Definition**: An aquifer that is open to the atmosphere through permeable material, with its upper surface marked by the water table.
    - **Recharge/Discharge**:
        - **Recharge**: Water added to the aquifer raises the water table.
        - **Discharge**: Water removed from the aquifer lowers the water table.
    - **Springs**: Water can flow from an unconfined aquifer to the surface as springs (e.g., Garam Pani Kund in Madhya Pradesh).
- **Confined Aquifer**:
    
    - **Definition**: Bounded by impermeable layers both above and below, water in confined aquifers is typically under pressure.
    - **Characteristics**: When tapped by a well, water may rise above the aquifer and possibly even above ground level.
- **Perched Aquifer**:
    
    - **Definition**: A small, unconfined aquifer that sits above an impermeable layer, with limited extent and storage capacity.
    - **Characteristics**: Often found in isolated pockets with a water table that supports groundwater recharge within a limited area.
- **Potentiometric Surface**:
    
    - The level to which water in a confined aquifer would rise if not restrained, representing the hydrostatic pressure within the aquifer.

---

#### 3. **Other Subsurface Hydrogeological Formations**

- **Aquiclude**: An impermeable formation that can store water but does not allow water to pass through it (e.g., clay).
- **Aquitard (Leaky Aquifer)**: A formation with low permeability, allowing slow water movement and capable of providing seepage to adjacent aquifers (e.g., sandy clay).
- **Aquifuge**: An impermeable layer that neither contains nor transmits water (e.g., hard, compact rocks).

---

#### 4. **Types of Groundwater**

- **Connate Water (Fossil Water)**: Trapped in the pores of sedimentary rocks at the time of their formation.

---

#### 5. **Occurrence and Movement of Groundwater**

    - **Topography**: High areas promote groundwater recharge, while low areas may store or discharge groundwater.
    - **Vadose Zone**: The unsaturated area above the water table affecting how quickly water reaches aquifers.
    - **Geological Formation**: Rock porosity and permeability impact groundwater movement and storage.
- **Types of Porosity**:
    
    - **Primary Porosity**: Original spaces in rock, typically intergranular (between grains).
    - **Secondary Porosity**: Result of rock fracturing or dissolution, forming spaces within the rock (fracture and vuggy porosity).
- **Groundwater Flow (Darcy’s Law)**:
    
    - Governs the rate of groundwater flow, dependent on factors like hydraulic head difference, hydraulic conductivity, and cross-sectional area of flow.

---

#### 6. **Effluent vs. Influent Streams**

- **Effluent (Gaining) Streams**:
    
    - Receive water from adjacent aquifers when the groundwater level is higher than the streambed.
    - **Characteristics**: Common in humid regions where streams are fed by groundwater.
- **Influent (Losing) Streams**:
    
    - Lose water to aquifers as water seeps from the streambed into the groundwater.
    - **Characteristics**: Typical in arid or semi-arid regions where streams help recharge local aquifers.

2. **Other Subsurface Formations**: Include aquicludes, aquitards, and aquifuges, which affect water storage and movement differently from aquifers.
    
3. **Types of Groundwater**: Groundwater can be classified based on its origin, such as connate (fossil), meteoric (from precipitation), and magmatic (from volcanic activity).
    
4. **Occurrence and Movement**: Groundwater movement depends on geological factors like porosity and permeability, governed by Darcy's Law.
    
5. **Effluent vs. Influent Streams**: Effluent (gaining) streams receive water from groundwater, while influent (losing) streams recharge groundwater.
