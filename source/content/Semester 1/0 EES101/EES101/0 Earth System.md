## Earth System and Components

1. **Sub-systems/Components of Earth**:
    
    - **Atmosphere**: The layer of gases surrounding Earth, essential for climate, weather, and life processes.
    - **Hydrosphere**: All water on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and underground water.
    - **Lithosphere**: The rigid outer part of the Earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.
    - **Biosphere**: The regions of Earth that support life, including land, water, and the atmosphere.
    - **Magnetosphere**: The area surrounding Earth where its magnetic field dominates, protecting the planet from solar winds.
2. **The Climate System**:

	- **Atmosphere**:
	    - The gaseous envelope surrounding Earth, extending from the surface up to about 100 km.
	- **Hydrosphere**:
	    - Comprises all surface waters including oceans, lakes, rivers, and groundwater.
	- **Biosphere**:
	    - Includes all organic matter related to life near Earth’s surface, interacting with other components of the climate system.
	- **Cryosphere**:
	    - Encompasses polar ice caps, glaciers, and other surface ice and snow that play a role in reflecting solar radiation and regulating global temperatures.
	- **Lithosphere**:
	    - The solid outer shell of the Earth that interacts with other subsystems (e.g., through weathering, erosion, and volcanic activity).
	- This Geosystem is powered by Solar Radiation
3. **The Plate Tectonic System**:
	
	- **Lithosphere**:
	    - Strong, rocky outer shell of the solid Earth that includes the crust and uppermost mantle.
	    - Extends to an average depth of about 100 km and forms tectonic plates.
	- **Asthenosphere**:
	    - A weak, ductile layer of the mantle located beneath the lithosphere.
	    - *Deforms to accommodate horizontal and vertical movements of tectonic plates.*
	- **Deep Mantle**:
	    - The region beneath the asthenosphere, extending from around 400 km depth to the core-mantle boundary (approximately 2900 km deep).
	    -*Plays a role in heat-driven convection currents that drive plate motion.*
	- This Geosystem is powered by Earth's Internal heat
4. **The Geodynamo System**:
	
	- **Inner Core**:
	    - A solid sphere composed primarily of iron.
	    - Extends from a depth of about 5150 km to the Earth's center at approximately 6370 km.
	- **Outer Core**:
	    - A liquid shell composed primarily of molten iron.
	    - Extends from about 2900 km to 5150 km in depth.
	    - *The motion of molten iron in the outer core generates Earth's magnetic field.*
	- This Geosystem is powered by Earth's Internal heat
5. **Earth System Science**:
    
    - A holistic approach to studying Earth as a system of interacting components.
    - **Focus**: Understand changes within and among Earth's subsystems.
    - **Key Areas**: Ocean, atmosphere, continents, lakes, rivers, soils, plants, and animals, all interconnected.

### Earth Science Overview

1. **What is Earth Science?**
    
    - **Definition**: Earth science (geoscience) encompasses all natural sciences related to the study of Earth’s physical, chemical, and biological components.
    - **Scope**: It includes the study of Earth as well as nearby extraterrestrial neighbors.
2. **Disciplines within Earth Sciences**:
    
    - **Geology**: Study of Earth's solid materials (rocks, minerals).
        - **Branches of Geology**:
            - **Mineralogy**: Study of minerals.
            - **Petrology**: Study of rocks.
            - **Ore Geology**: Study of mineral deposits.
            - **Structural Geology**: Study of Earth's structures (e.g., faults).
            - **Paleontology**: Study of fossils.
            - **Hydrogeology**: Study of water in the Earth.
    - **Geophysics**: Use of physics to solve geological problems.
        - Techniques include:
            - **Electrical**: Study of Earth’s conductivity.
            - **Magnetic**: Study of Earth’s magnetic field.
            - **Gravitational**: Study of variations in Earth's gravity.
        - **Goal**: Explain observed phenomena and predict future occurrences.

### Scientific Method in Earth Science

1. **Systematic Observations**: Fundamental observations lead to hypotheses and theories.
    
2. **Hypothesis**:
    
    - A tentative explanation based on initial observations.
3. **Theory**:
    
    - A well-supported explanation that can explain new data and make predictions.
    - Not all geological phenomena can be experimentally proven due to the timescale (millions of years vs. human lifetime).
4. **Scientific Model**:
    
    - Simplified representations of complex systems to understand and predict Earth processes.

### Historical Contributions

1. **James Hutton**:
    
    - Known for the concept that "The present is the key to the past", emphasizing the continuity of Earth processes.
2. **Charles Lyell**:
    
    - Principle of **Uniformitarianism**: Geological processes we observe today have been operating in the same way throughout Earth's history.
