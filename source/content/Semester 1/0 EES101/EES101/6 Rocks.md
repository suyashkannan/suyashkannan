## Lithification, Diagenesis, and Classification of Sedimentary Rocks

---

### 1. **Lithification**

- **Definition**: The process of transforming loose sediments into solid sedimentary rock.
- **Stages of Lithification**:
    1. **Compaction**:
        - Occurs as the weight of overlying sediments increases.
        - Forces sediment grains closer together, reducing pore space and eliminating some water.
        - **Factors Influencing Compaction**:
            - Temperature increases with depth (approximately 30 ºC per kilometer).
            - Pressure increases (approximately 1 atmosphere for every 4.4 m of depth).
    2. **Cementation**:
        - Involves the precipitation of dissolved minerals from groundwater that fill the spaces between sediment grains.
        - Binds sediments together into a solid rock, further decreasing porosity.
        - **Porosity**: The volume of empty space within sediment that can be filled with fluids.

---

### 2. **Diagenesis**

- **Definition**: The process of physical and chemical changes that sediments undergo as they are buried deeper into the Earth’s crust, typically at temperatures <200 ºC and pressures <300 MPa.
- **Processes Involved in Diagenesis**:
    - Replacement of sediment grains and fossils with other minerals (e.g., calcite, siderite, pyrite, marcasite).
    - Formation of new minerals.
- **Impact**: Diagenesis continues until the sediments are either exposed to weathering or transformed by metamorphism under higher temperatures and pressures.

    - Understanding the geological processes involved in the formation of metamorphic rocks provides insights into:
        - Mountain-building processes related to plate tectonics.
        - The conditions under which rocks undergo metamorphism.
        - The distribution of valuable minerals (both metallic and non-metallic).

    - Lower limit for metamorphism: ~150 ºC.
    - Increased temperatures due to subduction and contact with hot igneous intrusions.
2. **Pressure**:
    - Increases with depth; exerted equally (confining pressure) or in a specific direction (directed pressure).
    - **Types of Pressure**:
        - **Confining Pressure**: Equal force in all directions due to overlying rock weight.
        - **Directed Pressure**: Force applied in a specific direction, significant at convergent plate boundaries, guiding crystal orientation.
3. **Fluids**:
    - Hydrothermal fluids (dissolved substances in hot water) can alter mineral compositions without changing texture.
    - The process of changing a rock's composition by the transport of chemical substances is called **metasomatism**.
