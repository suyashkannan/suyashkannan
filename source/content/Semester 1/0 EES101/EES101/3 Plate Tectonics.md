### 1. **Lithospheric Plates**

- **Lithosphere**: The solid outer layer of Earth, comprising the **brittle upper portion of the mantle** and the **crust**.
    - Divided into two types:
        1. **Continental lithosphere**: Less dense, thicker.
        2. **Oceanic lithosphere**: Denser, thinner.
- These plates are **solid** and **brittle** and float on the partially molten **asthenosphere**.

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Asthenosphere**: Viscoelastic layer beneath the lithosphere that can deform and flow.
- **Convection Cells**: Hot material rises, cools, and sinks back down, creating currents that drive **plate tectonics** (movement of lithospheric plates).

### 2. **History of Plate Tectonics**

- **Theory of Plate Tectonics**: Earth's outer layer is composed of plates that have moved throughout Earth's history.
    
- **Alfred Wegener**:
    
    - Proposed the theory of **Continental Drift** in 1912.
    - Suggested that continents were once part of a single supercontinent called **Pangaea**, which broke apart and drifted to their current positions about **225–300 million years ago**.
- **Continental Drift** was initially rejected but later accepted after advancements in scientific understanding.
    
- **Dr. Harry Hess (1960)**: Proposed the theory of **Sea Floor Spreading**, which explained the formation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges, leading to the movement of tectonic plates.
    

#### Contributions of Plate Tectonic Theory:

- Explains:
    - **Mountain ranges** (e.g., Himalayas).
    - **Volcanoes**.
    - Presence of **similar species** on different continents.
    - **Oceanic basins**.
    - Absence of **oceanic crust older than the Jurassic Period** (due to subduction).

### 1. **Types of Plate Boundaries**

Plate boundaries are classified based on how two tectonic plates interact with each other. The major types include:

1. **Convergent Boundaries**:
    
    - Plates move toward each other.
    - **Ocean-Ocean Plate Convergence**:
        - One oceanic plate is subducted beneath another.
        - Example: **Pacific Plate** subducting beneath the **Philippine Plate** – forms **Mariana Trench**.
    - **Ocean-Continent Plate Convergence**:
        - Denser oceanic plate subducts under a continental plate.
        - Example: **Nazca Plate** subducting beneath the **South American Plate** – forms the **Andes Mountains**.
    - **Continent-Continent Convergence**:
        - When two continental plates collide, creating mountain ranges.
        - Example: **Indian Plate** and **Eurasian Plate** – forms the **Himalayas**.
2. **Divergent Boundaries**:
    
    - Plates move apart from each other.
    - Occurs at **Mid-Ocean Ridges (MORs)** where new oceanic crust forms as magma rises from the mantle.
        - Example: **Mid-Atlantic Ridge**.
    - **Continental Rifts** occur when continental plates move apart, creating rift valleys.
        - Example: **East African Rift Valley**.
3. **Transform Boundaries**:
    
    - Plates slide past each other.
    - **Crust is neither created nor destroyed**.
    - Commonly found in ocean basins connecting offsets in mid-ocean ridges or between a ridge and a subduction zone.
    - Example: **San Andreas Fault** in California.
4. **Triple Junctions**:
    
    - Points where three lithospheric plates meet.
    - The three types of boundaries that can meet are:
        - **Divergent (R)** – Ridge.
        - **Convergent (T)** – Trench.
        - **Transform (F)** – Fault.
    - Different types of triple junctions include **RRR**, **TTT**, **RTF**, **FFT**, etc.
    - There are **108 known triple junctions**.

### 2. **Continental Drift**

- Proposed by **Alfred Wegener** in 1912.
- The theory suggests that all continents were once joined together in a single supercontinent called **Pangea** and have since drifted apart.
- **Fit of Coastlines**: The matching coastlines of South America and Africa provide evidence for continental drift.
- Evidence of **similar plants and animals** on different continents suggests they were once connected and shared common ecosystems until the breakup of Pangea. After separation, species evolved independently.
- Examples of evidence for **continental drift**:
    - **Similar type and age of rocks** on different continents.
    - **Fossils of the same species** of extinct plants and animals found on widely spaced continents.
    - **Glacial striations and deposits** in present-day tropical regions, suggesting they were once near the poles.
    - **Coral reefs** found in areas that are much colder today, indicating continental movement from tropical regions.

---

### 3. **Seafloor Spreading**

- Proposed by **Dr. Harry Hess** in 1960.
- The process of new oceanic crust forming at **mid-ocean ridges (MORs)** as magma rises and solidifies.
- **Evidence for Seafloor Spreading**:
    - **Magnetic Anomalies**: Variations in Earth's magnetic field detected in alternating bands of normal and reversed polarity on either side of a mid-ocean ridge.
    - **Magnetic Chrons**: Major periods during which Earth's magnetic field has either normal or reversed polarity.
    - **Age of Oceanic Crust**: The ocean floor is youngest near mid-ocean ridges and gets progressively older away from the ridge, confirmed by mapping the age of seafloor crust.
- **Magnetic Reversal**: Periodic flipping of Earth's magnetic field, where the north and south magnetic poles switch places.
    - Magnetic reversals have occurred roughly every 200,000 to 300,000 years, with the last major reversal happening **780,000 years ago**.
    - During reversals, Earth’s magnetic field weakens, which could affect animals that rely on magnetism for navigation and may reduce Earth’s protection from cosmic rays.

---

### 4. **Evidences for Continental Drift and Seafloor Spreading**

- **Fit of Coastlines**: Matching shapes of continents, particularly between South America and Africa.
- **Fossil Evidence**: Fossils of the same species found on continents that are now separated by oceans.
- **Geological Evidence**:
    - Similar rock formations and ages on different continents.
    - Glacial deposits found near the equator, indicating past polar positions.
- **Magnetic Anomalies**: Parallel bands of normal and reversed magnetic polarity on the ocean floor provide evidence of seafloor spreading.
- **Age of Oceanic Crust**: Mapping the age of the seafloor shows that the ocean floor is youngest at mid-ocean ridges and older as you move away, supporting the idea of new crust being formed and spread outward.

---

### 5. **Magnetic Reversals and Fluxgate Magnetometer**

- **Fluxgate Magnetometer**: Originally used during WWII to detect submarines, this tool was later adapted to measure Earth's magnetic field and helped confirm seafloor spreading.
- **Magnetic Reversals**: Flips in Earth's magnetic field recorded in cooling magma at mid-ocean ridges, preserved in rocks as **thermoremanent magnetization**.
- Magnetic anomalies are detected when ships pass over rocks with different magnetic alignments. Positive magnetic anomalies occur when the ship is above rocks with normal polarity, and negative anomalies occur over reversed polarity rocks.
- **Impact of Magnetic Reversal**: During magnetic reversals, Earth’s magnetic field weakens, which could lead to reduced protection from solar wind and cosmic radiation.

---

### Conclusion

The combination of **continental drift** and **seafloor spreading** forms the basis of modern **plate tectonics** theory. The movement of lithospheric plates reshapes Earth’s surface over geological time, creating features such as mountains, oceanic ridges, and rift valleys, and explaining the distribution of fossils, rock types, and geological structures across continents. Magnetic anomalies and reversals provide further evidence for the dynamic nature of Earth’s lithosphere and help scientists understand the history of plate movements.

### 1. **Recap of Previous Topics**

1. **Types of Plate Boundaries**:
    
    - **Convergent Boundaries**: Plates move toward each other, leading to subduction or mountain formation.
    - **Divergent Boundaries**: Plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new crust.
    - **Transform Boundaries**: Plates slide past each other without creating or destroying crust.
2. **Continental Drift**:
    
    - Proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, it states that continents were once joined as a supercontinent called Pangea and have since drifted apart.
3. **Seafloor Spreading**:
    
    - The process where new oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges (MORs) as magma rises, solidifies, and moves outward, supporting the theory of plate tectonics.

### 2. **New Concepts**

#### **Magma vs Lava**

- **Magma**: Molten rock that is still underground beneath the Earth's surface.
- **Lava**: Magma that has reached the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions.

#### **Isochrons**:

- **Isochrons** are lines or contours on a map that connect points of the same age on the seafloor.
- When the distance between two isochrons is larger, it indicates a faster rate of seafloor spreading and the creation of more oceanic crust.

#### **Drivers of Plate Tectonics**:

- **Pull**: Gravitational pull from the cold, dense slabs of subducting lithosphere pulls plates downward into the mantle, a process known as "slab pull."
- **Push**: Convection currents in the mantle — the rising of hot material and the sinking of cooler material — act as a driving force for plate movements. This is referred to as "mantle convection."

---

### 3. **Subduction and Recycling of Plates**

- **Subducted Plates**: These plates are drawn into the mantle and may be recycled back into the Earth's interior.
- **How Do We Know?**: The study of **inclusions in minerals** (small fragments trapped within larger minerals) provides evidence of plate recycling. These inclusions carry information from the mantle, helping scientists understand the recycling process.
- Subducted plates can reach deep into the mantle, potentially even to the **core-mantle boundary**.

#### **Mantle Plumes**:

- **Mantle plumes** are narrow, hot upwellings of mantle material that rise from the core-mantle boundary.
    - These plumes have a **narrow "tail"** and a **wide "head"** near the lithosphere due to heat pooling.
- **Mantle Plumes and Hotspots**:
    - A **hotspot** forms when a mantle plume reaches the Earth's surface and creates volcanic activity.
    - Unlike other volcanoes, **hotspot volcanoes** form far from plate boundaries.
    - As tectonic plates move over the fixed plume, a chain of volcanoes may form.
    - Example: The **Yellowstone Hotspot**, located beneath North America, is creating a chain of volcanic activity as the continent moves westward.

---

### 4. **Examples of Hotspots**

- **Hawaii**: Formed by the Pacific Plate moving over a stationary mantle plume, creating a chain of volcanic islands.
- **Yellowstone**: The hotspot beneath North America has created a series of volcanic events, including the Yellowstone Caldera.

---

### 5. **Plate Recycling and Mineral Inclusions**

- **Inclusions**: Tiny particles trapped within larger minerals in subducted plates can provide clues about the recycling of plates into the Earth's mantle.
- **Recycling Evidence**: These inclusions allow scientists to trace the history of subducted plates and their journey into the deeper mantle.

---

### 6. **Mantle Convection and Plate Tectonics**

- The **mantle convection** process is a key driver of plate tectonics. The rising of hot material and the sinking of cooler material in the mantle causes plates to move.
- **Hot mantle material** rises at mid-ocean ridges, creating new crust, while cooler, denser plates sink back into the mantle at subduction zones.

---

### Summary of Key Concepts:

- **Magma** becomes **lava** once it reaches the Earth's surface.
- **Isochrons** help map the age of the seafloor and indicate spreading rates.
- **Plate movement** is driven by slab pull (gravity) and mantle convection.
- **Mantle plumes** are responsible for creating **hotspots** and volcanic activity away from plate boundaries.
- **Recycling of subducted plates** can be traced through inclusions in minerals that offer evidence of mantle processes.

These concepts form a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind plate tectonics and the dynamic nature of Earth's surface.
