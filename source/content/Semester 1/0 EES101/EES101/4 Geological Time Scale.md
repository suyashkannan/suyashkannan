## Geological Time Scale and Principles of Stratigraphy
---

### 2. **New Topics**

#### **Geological Time Scale**:

- The Earth's history spans approximately **4.6 billion years**.
- Divided into eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages to organize Earth's history and major geological events.

#### **Relative Age vs Absolute Age**:

- **Relative Age**: Determines if one rock or event is older or younger than another without knowing their exact ages.
- **Absolute Age**: Provides the actual age of rocks or events, often determined through radiometric dating techniques.

---

### 3. **Principles of Stratigraphy**:

The study of rock layers (**strata**) and their formation, used to determine the relative age of geological formations.

1. **Principle of Original Horizontality**:
    
    - Proposed by **Nicolas Steno** (1660s).
    - Sediments are originally deposited in horizontal or nearly horizontal layers due to gravity.
2. **Principle of Superposition**:
    
    - Younger layers of rock lie above older layers in an undisturbed sequence.
    - In a stratigraphic column, the **oldest strata** are at the bottom, and the **youngest** are at the top.
3. **Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships**:
    
    - Geologic features (like faults or igneous intrusions) that cut across strata are younger than the strata they cut through.
4. **Principle of Faunal Succession**:
    
    - Each fossil species represents a unique period in Earth's history.
    - Fossils in strata can be used to match layers across different locations (useful for correlating strata in places like Ajmer and Arizona).
    - **William Smith** (1790s) helped develop this principle.

### 4. **Relative Age Determination Example**:

Consider a sequence of geological events (rock layers and intrusions) from A-I:

- **B-F** are sedimentary layers.
- **H and G** are igneous intrusions.
- **A** is a fault, and **I** is an erosional surface.

Using principles of stratigraphy:

- Rock layer **H** cuts into B-F, so H is younger than B-F.
- Fault **A** cuts across B-F, so A is younger than those layers but older than **H**.
- **G** cuts across A-H, so G is younger than all those layers.
- **I**, the erosional surface, cuts both A and G, making it the youngest feature in the sequence.

**Relative Age Order**: F, E, D, C, B, (H or A), G, I (youngest)

---

### 5. **Drawbacks of Relative Age Dating**:

- **Widely Separated Strata**: Matching strata in places far apart (e.g., Ajmer and Arizona) may be difficult if they lack fossils.
- **Unrecorded Time Intervals**: Erosion may remove strata, creating gaps in the geological record.

---

### 6. **Absolute Age Determination**:

- **Absolute Dating**: Techniques like **radiometric dating** provide the actual age of rocks by measuring the decay of radioactive isotopes.

---

### Summary:

- **Geological Time** covers 4.6 billion years and is divided into various scales.
- **Stratigraphy** provides essential principles to determine the relative age of rock layers.
- Fossils, layering, and cross-cutting relationships help to map Earth's history.
- **Relative dating** helps place rocks and events in chronological order, while **absolute dating** gives a precise age.

## Unconformity and Geologic Time

### 1. **Unconformity**

- **Definition**: An unconformity is a surface between two rock layers that represents a missing layer, either because it was never formed or was eroded away.

#### **Types and Causes of Unconformity**:

- **Tectonic Forces**: Uplift or subsidence can cause an area to rise above sea level, leading to erosion of top layers.
- **Sea-Level Changes**: Falling sea levels can expose rock layers, which are then subject to erosion.

#### **Sea-Level Fall**:

- Causes: Glaciation, tectonic uplift, or thermal contraction of ocean basins.

#### **Fossils and Correlation**:

- Similar fossils found across different continents allow geologists to correlate strata and refine the geological time scale globally.

---

### 2. **Drawbacks of Relative Age Dating**:

- **Strata Separated in Space**: Relative dating may be challenging when strata are widely separated geographically, such as between Ajmer (India) and Arizona (USA). However, the **principle of faunal succession** can help correlate these layers.
- **Unrecorded Time Intervals**: Erosion may remove layers, leaving gaps in the geological record (e.g., missing fossiliferous strata).

---

### 3. **Intervals of Geologic Time**

The geologic time scale organizes Earth's history into hierarchical divisions.

#### **Eons**:

1. **Hadean** (4.6 to 4 billion years ago): Formation of the Earth.
2. **Archean** (4 to 2.5 billion years ago): First evidence of life.
3. **Proterozoic** (2.5 billion to 541 million years ago): Rise of oxygen, complex life forms.
4. **Phanerozoic** (541 million years ago to present): Life proliferates, divided into eras.

#### **Eras of the Phanerozoic**:

1. **Paleozoic** (541-252 million years ago):
    
    - Age of invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, and early land plants.
    - Ends with the **Permian mass extinction** (95% of species died).
2. **Mesozoic** (252-66 million years ago):
    
    - Age of reptiles, notably dinosaurs.
    - Ends with the **Cretaceous mass extinction** (75% of species, including dinosaurs, perished).
3. **Cenozoic** (66 million years ago to present):
    
    - Age of mammals.
    - We live in this era.

#### **Subdivisions**:

- **Periods**: E.g., Jurassic Period (famous for dinosaurs), Cambrian Period (Cambrian explosion).
- **Epochs**: Subdivisions of periods.
- **Ages**: Subdivisions of epochs.

---

### 4. **Mass Extinctions**:

- Marked by sharp declines in biodiversity, often defining the boundaries between geologic periods and eras.
    - **Cretaceous Extinction**: 75% of species lost (dinosaurs included).
    - **Permian Extinction**: 95% of marine species and significant land species perished.

---

### 5. **Petroleum Formation**:

- Formed from the remains of ancient algae and plants, buried under sediments in shallow seas.
- Over millions of years, under high pressure and temperature, organic material transformed into fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum).

#### **Petroleum Source Rocks**:

- **Age**: Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras have many petroleum source rocks.
- **Precambrian** rocks: Unlikely to have petroleum source rocks due to the absence of significant organic material from that time.

---

### 6. **Relative Age Determination: Example**

Consider rock layers and events (A-I) with faults and intrusions:

- **Oldest to Youngest**: F, E, D, C, B, (H or A), G, I.
    - Rock **H** cuts into layers B-F, so H is younger.
    - Fault **A** cuts B-F but not H, so A is younger than B-F but its relation to H is uncertain.
    - **G** (igneous intrusion) cuts across A-H, making it younger than all.
    - The erosional surface **I** is the youngest feature as it cuts both A and G.

---

### Summary:

- **Unconformities** represent missing time in the geologic record due to erosion or non-deposition.
- **Geologic time** is divided into eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages, with significant events such as mass extinctions defining boundaries.
- **Relative dating** helps establish the order of events but may have limitations, especially when fossils are missing or strata are eroded.
- **Petroleum source rocks** are often found in Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata.

## Radioactivity, Absolute Age, Radiocarbon Dating, and The Oldest Rocks

---

### 1. **Radioactivity**

- **Definition**: The spontaneous emission of radiation from an unstable atomic nucleus.
- **Pioneers**:
    - **Henri Becquerel**: Discovered radioactivity in 1896.
    - **Marie and Pierre Curie**: Isolated radioactive elements (e.g., radium, polonium).
    - **Ernest Rutherford**: Developed techniques for determining the age of rocks using uranium decay.

#### **Key Concepts**:

- **Radioactive Decay**: The process by which unstable isotopes lose energy by emitting radiation, transforming into another element.
- **Parent Isotope**: The original unstable radioactive element.
- **Daughter Isotope**: The stable product of the decay process.
- **Half-life**: The time it takes for half of the parent isotopes to decay into daughter isotopes.

---

### 2. **Absolute Age**

- **Definition**: Absolute age dating determines the actual age (in years) of rocks or geological events.
- **Geochronology**: The science of determining the age of rocks using radiometric dating techniques.

#### **Radiometric Dating**:

- Uses the decay rates of radioactive isotopes to determine the age of rocks.
- **Key Isotopes Used**:
    - **Uranium (U) → Lead (Pb)**
    - **Potassium (K) → Argon (Ar)**
    - **Rubidium (Rb) → Strontium (Sr)**

#### **Process**:

1. Measure the ratio of parent to daughter isotopes using **mass spectrometers**.
2. Use the known half-life of the parent isotope to calculate the age.

#### **Limitations**:

- The radiometric age provides the time when a system became closed (e.g., when a mineral first crystallized), but it may not indicate the time of sedimentary rock formation.

---

### 3. **Radiocarbon Dating (C-14 Dating)**

- **Definition**: A method for determining the age of organic materials using the decay of **Carbon-14**.
- **Isotopes of Carbon**:
    - **Carbon-12 (C-12)**: Stable, 6 protons, 6 neutrons.
    - **Carbon-13 (C-13)**: Stable, 6 protons, 7 neutrons.
    - **Carbon-14 (C-14)**: Radioactive, 6 protons, 8 neutrons.

#### **Key Concepts**:

- **Carbon-14 Formation**: Formed in Earth's upper atmosphere and incorporated into plant tissues.
- **Decay**: After the plant dies, the **C-14** decays into nitrogen-14 (**N-14**), while **C-12** remains stable.
- **Age Determination**: The ratio of C-14 to C-12 in a sample is used to estimate the age of organic matter.

#### **Half-Life**:

- The half-life of **C-14** is **5,730 years**.
- Effective for dating materials up to **70,000 years old** (older samples have too little C-14 to measure accurately).

#### **Applications**:

- Dating materials from the **Holocene** epoch (e.g., remains of early human civilizations).
