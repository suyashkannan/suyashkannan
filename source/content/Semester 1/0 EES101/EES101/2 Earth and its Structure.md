### 1. **Formation of Earth ("Earth's Birth")**

- **The 3 S's**: These might refer to key structural or environmental factors related to Earth's formation.
- **Geoid**: Earth's shape, which is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid. Due to the rotation, it bulges at the equator.
- **What Lies Under Our Feet?**
    - Focuses on the layers beneath Earth's surface such as:
        1. **Crust**: Outermost layer.
        2. **Mantle**: Beneath the crust, composed mainly of silicate minerals.
        3. **Outer Core**: Composed of liquid iron and nickel.
        4. **Inner Core**: Solid, mostly iron.

## Current Class: Earth's Interior and Seismic Waves

### 1. **Seismic Waves**

- **Definition**: Vibrations generated by an earthquake, explosion, or another energetic source, traveling through Earth's interior or along its surface.
- **Seismographs**: Devices used to record the amplitude and frequency of seismic waves, which provide data about Earth’s subsurface structure.
- **Artificial Seismic Waves**: Used for hydrocarbon exploration (oil and gas).

#### Types of Seismic Waves:

- **P Waves (Primary/Compressional/Pressure Waves)**:
    - First to reach recording stations.
    - Cause ground to compress and expand.
    - Particles move **parallel** to the direction of propagation.
    - Can travel through both solid and liquid.
    - Slow down in liquid.
- **S Waves (Secondary/Shear Waves)**:
    - Particles move **perpendicular** to the direction of propagation.
    - Cause ground to move up, down, or side to side.
    - Can travel only through solid (not through liquid).
    - Slower than P waves.

#### **Seismic Shadow Zone**:

- **P Waves**: Cannot be detected between angular distances of **103° and 140°** from the earthquake epicenter due to refraction by the liquid outer core.
- **S Waves**: Cannot be detected beyond an angular distance of **103°** because they cannot pass through the liquid outer core.
- **Discovery of the Outer Core**: The liquid outer core was identified based on the behavior of P and S waves in the early 1900s.

### 2. **Discontinuities in Earth's Interior**

- The Earth is not homogenous; there are variations in **chemical** and **physical** properties between different layers.
- **Discontinuities**:
    - Regions where seismic waves suddenly change speed or direction, indicating a change in material composition.
    - Example: **Mohorovičić Discontinuity (Moho)** between the crust and mantle.

### 3. **Earth’s Magnetism (Geomagnetic Field)**

- **Magnetic Elements**: Iron (Fe), Nickel (Ni), and Cobalt (Co) are magnetic materials found in the Earth's core.
- **Magnetic Poles**: The north pole of a magnet points to Earth's magnetic north pole, though these are not fixed.
- **Geodynamo Theory**: The circulation of molten iron and nickel in the outer core generates Earth's magnetic field. Convection in the outer core, rather than the mantle, is responsible for this dynamo effect.

#### Key Points on Earth’s Magnetic Field:

- **Rotational Axis vs. Magnetic Axis**: Earth's magnetic axis is tilted by about **11.5°** relative to its rotational axis.
- **Geomagnetic Pole Reversals**: The Earth’s magnetic poles have reversed hundreds of times in the past. These reversals are recorded in rocks as they cool and preserve the position of the geomagnetic poles.

### 4. **Growth of the Inner Core**

- The **inner core** is solidifying over time as the **liquid outer core** cools and solidifies.
- Growth rate: About **1 mm/year**.
- This growth is **non-uniform**, varying by region.

### 5. **Magnetosphere**

- **Description**: The Earth's magnetic field extends into space, creating a protective shield called the **magnetosphere**.
- **Interaction with Solar Wind**: Charged particles from the sun (solar wind) press the magnetosphere on the sun-facing side and stretch it into a teardrop shape on the shadow side.
- **Auroras (Northern/Southern Lights)**:
    - Formed when particles from the solar wind collide with gases in the upper atmosphere around the geomagnetic poles, creating light displays known as auroras.
    - **Northern Lights**: Aurora Borealis.
    - **Southern Lights**: Aurora Australis.
