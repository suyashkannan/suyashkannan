### Origin of Planets

**Key Concepts**:

- Planetesimals
- Protoplanets
- Planets

Theories explaining the origin of planets, including Earth, involve four main hypotheses:

### 1. **Nebular Hypothesis**

- **Proposed by**: Immanuel Kant (1755) and Pierre Laplace (1796).
- **Concept**: The Solar System formed from a rotating cloud of hot gases (nebula).
- **Process**:
    - The gas cooled gradually, causing the nebula to shrink and rotate faster.
    - This process led to the formation of a disk shape.
    - The **centrifugal force** and **gravitational force** led to the formation of rings of gas (forming planets and satellites), while the center formed the sun.

### 2. **Planetesimal Hypothesis**

- **Proposed by**: Forest Moulton and Thomas Chamberlin (1900).
- **Concept**: The Solar System formed when a passing star almost collided with the Sun.
	- **Process**:
    - Gravitational attraction created a bulge in the Sun, leading to the ejection of material (planetesimals).
    - These planetesimals later accreted to form planets.

### 3. **Tidal Hypothesis**

- **Proposed by**: James Jeans and Harold Jeffreys (early 1900s).
- **Concept**: The Solar System formed when an intruding star came close to the primitive Sun.
- **Process**:
    - Gravitational force created a tidal effect on the Sun’s surface, causing a cigar-shaped filament to be ejected.
    - As the filament cooled and contracted, it broke into pieces, forming planets. Larger planets formed at the center, and smaller planets formed towards the ends.

### 4. **Big Bang Hypothesis**

- **Proposed by**: Aleksander Friedmann and Georges Lemaître (1920s).
- **Concept**: The universe, including the Solar System, began from a hot, dense point approximately 13.7 billion years ago.
- **Process**:
    - A violent explosion (the Big Bang) initiated the expansion of the universe.
    - As the universe cooled, subatomic particles and elements (starting with helium and hydrogen) were created.

### **Earth’s Size and Shape**

- **Earth's Radius**: ~6371 km.
- **Shape**: **Oblate spheroid** or **ellipsoid**.
    - Earth bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles due to the centrifugal force generated by its rotation.
    - This force pushes mass away from the axis of rotation, leading to a flattening effect at the equator.
- **Diameter of The Earth**: $D_\text{p}=40,008km$ and $D_\text{e}=40,075km$

### **Earth's Surface**

- **Not Smooth**: Earth has varying elevations, with features such as mountains and ocean trenches.
- **Highest Point**: **Mt. Everest** (8848m).
- **Deepest Point**: **Challenger’s Deep** in the Mariana Trench (10935m). Few hundred miles away from Guam.

### **Geoid**

- **Definition**: The equipotential surface of Earth’s gravity field, which best fits the global mean sea level.
- **Importance**: The mass of the Earth is not uniform, so the magnitude of gravity varies, creating an irregular shape for the geoid.

### **Farthest Point from The Earth's centre**:

1. In 1802, *Humboldt and Bonpland* ascended Chimborazo, a volcano just below the equator that was believed at the time to be the highest mountain
2. The height of Mt. Everest was measured in the1850s by Radhanath Sikdar. 

### **Earth's Interior:**

1. MOHO refers to the crust mantle boundary.
2. Mass distribution of the Earth's layer:
```markdown
| Layer               | Depth (km)       | Mass Percentage | State         |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Crust               | 0 - 40           | 0.4%            | Solid         |
| Mantle              | 40 - 2890        | 67.1%           | Solid         |
| Outer Core          | 2890 - 5150      | 30.8%           | Liquid iron   |
| Inner Core          | 5150 - 6370      | 1.7%            | Solid iron    |
```

### **Earth’s Structure**

1. **Crust**:
    
    - **Oceanic Crust**:
        - Thickness: 7-10 km.
        - Composition: Basaltic.
        - Density: 2.8-3.0 g/cm³.
        - Younger compared to continental crust.
        - Oldest oceanic crust:  340 mya
    - **Continental Crust**:
        - Thickness: 35-40 km.
        - Composition: Granitic. (*less dense than basalt, hence low density of continental crust*)
        - Density: 2.6-2.7 g/cm³.
        - Older than oceanic crust.
        - Oldest continental crust : 4.4 bya
1. **Mantle**: 84% of earth's volume
    
    - **Upper Mantle**:
        - Depth: Up to 410 km.
        - Mostly solid.
        - Combined with the crust, forms the lithosphere (up to ~200 km deep), which constitutes tectonic plates: it is brittle and fractures at low temp
        - Temp 500-900 degree
		- Asthenosphere lies beneath the lithosphere
    - **Transition Zone**:
        - Depth: 410-660 km.
        - Solid-solid phase changes occur, leading to changes in crystalline structure.
        - Composition remains same but the crystalline structure changes.
    - **Lower Mantle**:
        - Depth: 660-2900 km.
        - Hotter, denser, and less viscous than the upper mantle.
        - Temperature ~4000ºC
1. **Core**:
    
    - **Outer Core**:
        - Depth: 2900-5100 km.
        - Composition: Liquid, mainly molten iron.
        - Responsible for generating Earth's magnetic field.
    - **Inner Core**:
        - Depth: 5100-6371 km.
        - Composition: Solid iron, *solid due to immense pressure despite high temperatures (~4400-6000°C).*
        - **The main source of heat is the radioactive decay occurring in the earth's core
