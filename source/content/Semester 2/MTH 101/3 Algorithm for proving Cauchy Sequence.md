# Algorithm for Proving a Sequence is Cauchy

## **Step 1: Define the Sequence**
1. Given a sequence $\{x_n\}$, express it as:
   $$
   x_n = f(n) \quad \text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}.
   $$
2. Recall the **Cauchy sequence definition**:
   - A sequence $\{x_n\}$ is **Cauchy** if for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m \geq N$:
     $$
     |x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon.
     $$

## **Step 2: Compute $|x_n - x_m|$**
1. Express the difference $|x_n - x_m|$ in simplified form.
2. Try bounding it using inequalities.
3. Assume **without loss of generality** that $m \leq n$ (this simplifies calculations).

## **Step 3: Find an Upper Bound for $|x_n - x_m|$**
1. Identify an expression that provides an upper bound for $|x_n - x_m|$.
2. Try to bound it using terms that shrink as $m, n \to \infty$.

## **Step 4: Choose $N$ Using the Archimedean Property**
1. Given $\varepsilon > 0$, find an integer $N$ such that for all $n, m \geq N$:
   $$
   |x_n - x_m| < \varepsilon.
   $$
2. Typically, this involves choosing $N$ such that:
   $$
   \frac{1}{N} < \varepsilon.
   $$
3. Confirm that for all $n, m \geq N$, the required condition holds.
