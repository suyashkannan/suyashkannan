#### **1. Cell Organelles and Their Functions**

- **Nucleus**:
    
    - **Nuclear Envelope**: Membrane with pores for material transport.
        
    - **Chromatin**: DNA and associated proteins.
        
    - **Nucleolus**: Site of ribosome formation.
        
- **Peroxisome**: Metabolizes waste, contains oxidative enzymes.
    
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**:
    
    - **Rough ER**: Protein synthesis (ribosomes attached).
        
    - **Smooth ER**: Lipid synthesis.
        
- **Cytoskeleton**:
    
    - **Microtubules**: Mitotic spindle, cell shape.
        
    - **Centrosome**: Microtubule organizing center.
        
    - **Intermediate Filaments**: Hold organelles in place.
        
    - **Microfilaments**: Form cellular cortex.
        
- **Plasma Membrane**: Regulates transport, contains lysosomes for digestion.
    
- **Golgi Apparatus**: Modifies and packages proteins.
    
- **Mitochondria**: Produces energy (ATP) via cellular respiration.
    
- **Plasmodesmata**: Channels connecting plant cells.
    
- **Cell Wall**: Maintains cell shape in plants.
    
- **Central Vacuole**: Maintains turgor pressure in plant cells.

#### **2. Peroxisomes: Structure and Function**

- **Location**: Found in all eukaryotic cells (animals, yeast, plants).
    
- **Structure**:
    
    - **Single Membrane**: No DNA or ribosomes.
        
    - **Oxidative Enzymes**: Catalase, urate oxidase.
        
- **Functions**:
    
    - **Oxidative Reactions**: Breakdown of fatty acids (beta-oxidation).
        
    - **Lipid Biosynthesis**: Synthesis of cholesterol, dolichol, bile acids.
        
    - **Detoxification**: Breaks down toxic substances like uric acid.
        
    - **Plasmalogen Synthesis**: Phospholipids in myelin.
        
- **Beta-Oxidation**:
    
    - **Mammalian Cells**: Occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes.
        
    - **Yeast and Plants**: Exclusively in peroxisomes.

#### **3. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Peroxisomes**

- **ROS**: Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) can damage biomolecules (proteins, DNA, lipids) but also acts as a signaling molecule at low levels.
    
- **Enzymes**:
    
    - **Catalase**: Converts H₂O₂ to water.
        
    - **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)**: Converts superoxide (O₂⁻) to H₂O₂.
        
    - **Glutathione Peroxidases**: Convert H₂O₂ to water.

#### **4. Peroxisomes in Plants**

- **Types**:
    
    - **Glyoxysomes**: Found in seeds, involved in the glyoxylate cycle.
        
    - **Leaf Peroxisomes**: Involved in photorespiration.
        
- **Glyoxylate Cycle**:
    
    - **Function**: Converts stored fatty acids to carbohydrates during seed germination.
        
    - **Location**: Glyoxysomes.
        
    - **Process**: Fatty acids → Acetyl-CoA → Carbohydrates (sucrose).
        
- **Photorespiration**:
    
    - **Function**: Uses O₂ and releases CO₂, occurs in leaf peroxisomes.

#### **5. Peroxisome Biogenesis**

- **Growth and Fission**: Peroxisomes grow by importing proteins and lipids from the cytosol and divide by fission.
    
- **Protein Import**: Peroxisomal proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into peroxisomes.
    
- **Membrane Formation**: Lipids for new peroxisome membranes are also imported.
