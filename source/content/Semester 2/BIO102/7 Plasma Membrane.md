#### **1. Plasma Membrane: Structure and Function**

- **Function**:
    
    - **Selective Barrier**: Regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
        
    - **Cell Signaling**: Contains receptors for communication.
        
    - **Cell Adhesion**: Helps cells stick together to form tissues.
        
- **Structure**:
    
    - **Lipid Bilayer**: Composed of phospholipids, cholesterol, and glycolipids.
        
    - **Proteins**: Integral and peripheral proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer.
        
    - **Carbohydrates**: Attached to lipids (glycolipids) or proteins (glycoproteins) on the extracellular surface.

#### **2. Historical Perspective on Plasma Membrane Discovery**

- **Robert Hooke (1665)**: First observed cells in cork, coined the term "cell."
    
- **Charles Overton (1902)**: Proposed that membranes are made of lipids.
    
- **Irving Langmuir (1917)**: Demonstrated that lipids form monolayers on water.
    
- **Gorter and Grendel (1925)**: Proposed the lipid bilayer model.
    
- **Davson and Danielli (1935)**: Proposed the "sandwich model" (lipid bilayer sandwiched between protein layers).
    
- **Singer and Nicolson (1972)**: Proposed the **Fluid Mosaic Model**, which is the current accepted model.

#### **3. Fluid Mosaic Model**

- **Key Features**:
    
    - **Fluidity**: Lipids and proteins can move laterally within the membrane.
        
    - **Mosaic**: Proteins are discontinuously embedded in the lipid bilayer.
        
- **Components**:
    
    - **Phospholipids**: Form the bilayer, with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails.
        
    - **Cholesterol**: Regulates membrane fluidity.
        
    - **Proteins**: Integral (span the membrane) and peripheral (attached to the surface).
        
    - **Carbohydrates**: Found on the extracellular surface, involved in cell recognition.

#### **4. Membrane Lipids**

- **Types**:
    
    - **Phosphoglycerides**: Most abundant (e.g., phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine).
        
    - **Sphingolipids**: Contain sphingosine (e.g., sphingomyelin).
        
    - **Cholesterol**: Regulates membrane fluidity and stability.
        
- **Asymmetry**:
    
    - **Outer Leaflet**: Rich in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin.
        
    - **Inner Leaflet**: Rich in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol.

#### **5. Membrane Proteins**

- **Types**:
    
    - **Integral Proteins**: Span the membrane (e.g., transporters, receptors).
        
    - **Peripheral Proteins**: Attached to the membrane surface (e.g., signaling proteins).
        
    - **Lipid-Anchored Proteins**: Attached to lipids in the membrane (e.g., GPI-anchored proteins).
        
- **Functions**:
    
    - **Transport**: Facilitate movement of molecules across the membrane.
        
    - **Signaling**: Receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters.
        
    - **Cell Adhesion**: Help cells stick together.

#### **6. Membrane Fluidity**

- **Factors Affecting Fluidity**:
    
    - **Temperature**: High temperature increases fluidity, low temperature decreases it.
        
    - **Cholesterol**: Stabilizes membrane fluidity by preventing excessive movement at high temperatures and preventing rigidity at low temperatures.
        
    - **Saturated vs. Unsaturated Fats**: Unsaturated fats increase fluidity due to kinks in their tails.
        
- **Importance**: Fluidity is crucial for membrane function, including transport and signaling.

#### **7. Transport Across the Plasma Membrane**

- **Passive Transport**:
    
    - **Simple Diffusion**: Small, non-polar molecules move directly through the lipid bilayer (e.g., O₂, CO₂).
        
    - **Facilitated Diffusion**: Polar molecules and ions move through protein channels or carriers (e.g., glucose transporters).
        
- **Active Transport**:
    
    - **Primary Active Transport**: Uses ATP to pump molecules against their gradient (e.g., Na⁺/K⁺ pump).
        
    - **Secondary Active Transport**: Uses the energy from an ion gradient to transport molecules (e.g., symporters, antiporters).
        

---

#### **8. Membrane Transport Proteins**

- **Carrier Proteins**:
    
    - Bind specific molecules and undergo conformational changes to transport them.
        
    - Example: Glucose transporters (GLUT).
        
- **Channel Proteins**:
    
    - Form pores that allow specific molecules or ions to pass through.
        
    - Examples: Ion channels, voltage-gated channels, ligand-gated channels.
        

---

#### **9. Primary Active Transport**

- **Na⁺/K⁺ Pump**:
    
    - Uses ATP to pump 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ into the cell.
        
    - Maintains the electrochemical gradient essential for nerve impulses and muscle contraction.
        
- **ABC Transporters**:
    
    - Use ATP to transport a wide range of molecules (e.g., ions, sugars, amino acids).
        

---

#### **10. Secondary Active Transport**

- **Symporters**: Transport molecules in the same direction as the ion gradient (e.g., Na⁺/glucose symporter).
    
- **Antiporters**: Transport molecules in the opposite direction to the ion gradient (e.g., Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger).
