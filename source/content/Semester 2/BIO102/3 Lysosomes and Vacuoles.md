### **1. Lysosomes and Vacuoles**

- **Lysosomes**:
    
    - **Function**: Membrane-enclosed organelles containing degradative enzymes (e.g., nucleases, proteases, lipases) that break down biological polymers.
        
    - **Pathways of Digestion**:
        
        - **Endocytosis**: Uptake of external materials.
            
        - **Phagocytosis**: Ingestion of large particles (e.g., bacteria).
            
        - **Autophagy**: Degradation of obsolete cell components.
            
    - **pH**: Lysosomal lumen is acidic (pH ~5), which is optimal for enzyme activity.
        
    - **Glycocalyx**: Protects lysosomal membrane from hydrolytic enzymes.
        
    - **Lysosomal Storage Diseases**: Caused by mutations in lysosomal enzyme genes (e.g., Gaucher’s disease, I-cell disease).
        
- **Vacuoles**:
    
    - **Function in Plant Cells**:
        
        - Maintain **turgor pressure** by regulating osmotic pressure.
            
        - Store substances like rubber, opium, and pigments (e.g., anthocyanins).
            
        - Degrade proteins and organelles, especially under nutrient stress.
            
        - Store ions, amino acids, carbohydrates, and waste materials.
            
    - **Tonoplast**: Membrane surrounding the vacuole.
        
    - **Role in pH Regulation**: Vacuoles help maintain cytosolic pH by releasing H+H+ ions.

#### **2. Glycocalyx Coat**

- **Composition**: Made up of oligosaccharide side chains of glycolipids, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans.
    
- **Location**: Found on the non-cytoplasmic surface of the membrane.
    
- **Function**: Protects the cell membrane and is involved in cell-cell recognition.

#### **3. Flow of Proteins from Translation to Destination**

- **Transmembrane Glycoproteins**: Proteins with carbohydrate chains that span the lipid bilayer.
    
- **Targeting Sequences**: Direct proteins to specific organelles (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes).
    
- **Vesicle Transport**: Proteins are transported via vesicles from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and then to their final destinations.

#### **4. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis**

- **Process**:
    
    - **Clathrin-Coated Pits**: Concentrate specific extracellular macromolecules (e.g., LDL particles).
        
    - **LDL Uptake**: Cells import cholesterol via LDL receptors.
        
    - **Lysosomal Degradation**: LDL particles are broken down in lysosomes to release free cholesterol.
        
- **Regulation**: Excess cholesterol inhibits both cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor production.

#### **5. Phagocytosis**

- **Definition**: A specialized form of endocytosis where large particles (e.g., bacteria, cellular debris) are ingested.
    
- **Professional Phagocytes**:
    
    - **Macrophages** and **Neutrophils**: White blood cells that defend against infection by ingesting microorganisms and scavenging damaged cells.
        
- **Process**: Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and ingested material is degraded.

#### **6. Isolation of Lysosomes**

- **Cell Fractionation**:
    
    - **Differential Centrifugation**: Separates organelles based on size and density.
        
    - **Equilibrium Density-Gradient Centrifugation**: Further purifies organelles like lysosomes, mitochondria, and peroxisomes.

#### **7. Vacuoles in Plant Cells**

- **Functions**:
    
    - **Turgor Pressure**: Maintains cell rigidity by regulating osmotic pressure.
        
    - **Storage**: Stores pigments, ions, amino acids, and waste materials.
        
    - **Protein Degradation**: Contains enzymes for breaking down damaged proteins and organelles.
        
    - **Buffering**: Recycles ions and amino acids to maintain homeostasis.
        
- **Tonoplast**: Membrane that surrounds the vacuole and regulates transport.
    

---

#### **8. Osmosis and Turgor Pressure**

- **Osmosis**: Movement of water across a semipermeable membrane depends on solute concentration.
    
- **Turgor Pressure**: Maintained by vacuoles in plant cells, which swell or shrink to regulate water content.
