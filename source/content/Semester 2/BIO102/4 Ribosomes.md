#### **2. Central Dogma of Molecular Biology**

- **Flow of Genetic Information**: DNA → RNA → Protein.
    
- **Processes**:
    
    - **Transcription**: DNA is transcribed into mRNA.
        
    - **Translation**: mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes.
        
- **Key Molecules**:
    
    - **mRNA**: Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
        
    - **tRNA**: Transfers amino acids to the ribosome during translation.
        
    - **Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases**: Enzymes that attach amino acids to tRNA.

#### **3. Historical Advances in Protein Synthesis**

- **Paul Zamenik (1950s)**:
    
    - Demonstrated that proteins are synthesized in the ribosomes by using radioactive amino acids.
        
- **Mahlon Hoagland and Zamenik**:
    
    - Discovered that amino acids are activated for protein synthesis by attaching to tRNA, forming aminoacyl-tRNAs.
        
- **Genetic Code Translation**:
    
    - tRNA acts as an adaptor, translating the nucleotide sequence of mRNA into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide.

#### **6. Genetic Code**

- **Triplet Codons**: The genetic code consists of triplets of nucleotides (codons) that specify amino acids.
    
- **Codons**:
    
    - **64 Possible Codons**: 4 nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in groups of three.
        
    - **20 Amino Acids**: Encoded by 61 codons, with 3 stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA).
        
- **Redundancy**: Most amino acids are encoded by multiple codons (e.g., leucine has 6 codons).
    
- **Key Experiments**:
    
    - **Nirenberg and Matthaei**: Used synthetic RNA to determine the codons for specific amino acids.
        
    - **Hargovind Khorana**: Synthesized polyribonucleotides with defined sequences to decipher the genetic code.
