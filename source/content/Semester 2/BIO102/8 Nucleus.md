#### **1. The Nucleus: Structure and Function**

- **Function**:
    
    - **Control Center**: Houses DNA and regulates gene expression.
        
    - **Ribosome Assembly**: Nucleolus produces ribosomal subunits.
        
    - **Traffic Regulation**: Nuclear pores control the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
        
- **Structure**:
    
    - **Nuclear Envelope**: Double membrane with nuclear pores.
        
    - **Nuclear Lamina**: Provides structural support.
        
    - **Chromatin**: DNA wrapped around histones, organized into chromosomes.
        
    - **Nucleolus**: Site of rRNA synthesis and ribosome assembly.

#### **2. Nuclear Pores and Transport**

- **Bidirectional Traffic**: Molecules move between the nucleus and cytoplasm through nuclear pores.
    
    - **Imported**: Histones, DNA/RNA polymerases, ribosomal proteins.
        
    - **Exported**: Ribosomal subunits, tRNAs, mRNAs.
        
- **Ribosome Assembly**: Ribosomal proteins are imported into the nucleus, assembled with rRNA, and exported as ribosomal subunits.

#### **3. Nucleolus: Ribosome Factory**

- **Function**:
    
    - **rRNA Transcription**: 45S rRNA precursor is transcribed and processed.
        
    - **Ribosome Assembly**: rRNA is combined with ribosomal proteins to form ribonucleoprotein particles.
        
    - **Export**: Ribosomal subunits are exported to the cytoplasm for final assembly.
        
- **Non-Coding RNAs**: Processed and assembled with proteins in the nucleolus.

#### **4. Chromosomes: Structure and Types**

- **Structure**:
    
    - **DNA**: Double-stranded molecule wrapped around histones to form nucleosomes.
        
    - **Chromatin**: DNA-protein complex that condenses to form chromosomes.
        
- **Types of Chromosomes**:
    
    - **Metacentric**: Centromere in the middle.
        
    - **Submetacentric**: Centromere slightly off-center.
        
    - **Acrocentric**: Centromere near one end.
        
    - **Telocentric**: Centromere at the end.

#### **5. Centromeres and Telomeres**

- **Centromere**:
    
    - **Location**: Middle of the chromosome.
        
    - **Function**: Site of kinetochore formation, essential for chromosome segregation during cell division.
        
- **Telomere**:
    
    - **Location**: Ends of the chromosome.
        
    - **Function**: Protects chromosome ends from degradation and fusion.
        
    - **Telomerase**: Enzyme that maintains telomere length by adding repetitive sequences.

#### **6. Polyploidy in Liver Cells**

- **Multinucleated Hepatocytes**: Liver cells often have multiple nuclei due to polyploidy.
    
- **Function**: Enhances protein synthesis for detoxification and metabolism.
    
- **Adaptation**: Considered a normal physiological adaptation, not a genetic error.
    

---

#### **7. Histone Proteins**

- **Function**: Histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4) package DNA into nucleosomes, regulating gene expression.
    
- **Isolation**: Histones can be isolated from nuclei using electrophoresis.
    

---

#### **8. Differential Centrifugation**

- **Process**: Separates cellular components based on size and density.
    
    - **Low Speed**: Whole cells, nuclei, cytoskeletons.
        
    - **Medium Speed**: Mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, peroxisomes.
        
    - **High Speed**: Microsomes, small vesicles.
        
    - **Very High Speed**: Ribosomes, viruses.
