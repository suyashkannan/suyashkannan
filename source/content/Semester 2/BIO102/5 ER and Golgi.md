#### **1. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**

- **Structure**:
    
    - **Rough ER**: Studded with ribosomes, involved in protein synthesis and processing.
        
    - **Smooth ER**: Lacks ribosomes, involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification.
        
- **Function**:
    
    - **Protein Biosynthesis**: Proteins synthesized in the rough ER are destined for secretion, lysosomes, or the plasma membrane.
        
    - **Lipid Biosynthesis**: Smooth ER synthesizes lipids for cell membranes.
        
    - **Calcium Storage**: Smooth ER stores calcium ions.
        
- **Separation of Rough and Smooth ER**:
    
    - **Centrifugation**: Rough ER (high density) sediments at higher sucrose concentrations, while smooth ER (low density) sediments at lower concentrations.

#### **2. Golgi Apparatus**

- **Structure**:
    
    - **Cis-Golgi Network**: Receives proteins and lipids from the ER.
        
    - **Medial Cisternae**: Intermediate processing compartments.
        
    - **Trans-Golgi Network**: Sorts and packages proteins for secretion or transport to other organelles.
        
- **Function**:
    
    - **Protein Modification**: Glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation occur in the Golgi.
        
    - **Secretion**: Proteins are packaged into vesicles for secretion (e.g., mucus in goblet cells).
        
    - **Sorting**: Proteins are sorted and directed to their final destinations (e.g., lysosomes, plasma membrane).

#### **3. Protein Targeting and Signal Sequences**

- **Signal Sequence**: A short sequence of amino acids (13-36 residues) that directs proteins to the ER.
    
- **Signal Recognition Particle (SRP)**: Binds to the signal sequence and directs the ribosome to the ER membrane.
    
- **Translocation**: Proteins are translocated into the ER lumen, where the signal sequence is often removed.

#### **4. Glycosylation**

- **N-linked Glycosylation**:
    
    - **Location**: Begins in the ER and continues in the Golgi.
        
    - **Process**: A 14-sugar oligosaccharide is transferred to an asparagine residue on the growing polypeptide.
        
- **O-linked Glycosylation**:
    
    - **Location**: Occurs exclusively in the Golgi.
        
    - **Process**: Sugars are added to serine or threonine residues.
        
- **Function**: Glycosylation plays a key role in protein folding, stability, and targeting.

#### **5. Functional Compartmentalization of the Golgi**

- **Processing Steps**:
    
    - **Cis-Golgi**: Phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins.
        
    - **Medial Golgi**: Removal of mannose residues, addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).
        
    - **Trans-Golgi**: Addition of galactose (Gal) and sialic acid (NANA), sulfation of tyrosines and carbohydrates.
        
- **Sorting**: Proteins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network for delivery to the plasma membrane, secretory vesicles, or lysosomes.

#### **6. Export and Degradation of Misfolded Proteins**

- **Misfolded Proteins**:
    
    - **Export**: Misfolded proteins in the ER are translocated back to the cytosol.
        
    - **Degradation**: Proteins are deglycosylated, ubiquitylated, and degraded by the proteasome.
        
- **Pathway**: Misfolded proteins use the same translocator (Sec61 complex) for export as they do for import.

#### **7. Goblet Cells and Secretion**

- **Function**: Goblet cells secrete mucus, a mixture of glycoproteins synthesized in the ER and Golgi.
    
- **Polarity**: Goblet cells are highly polarized, with the Golgi apparatus oriented toward the apical membrane for efficient secretion.
